    <p>Heyya! </p>
    <p>The name's Karl, but you can call me Carl.</p>

    <p>I am a SysAdmin & DevOps primarily, but have a curiosity for many things.</p>

    <p>If I'm not centering divs (like I said I wouldn't) or building another mechanical ortholinear ergonomic split
        keyboard then I'm probably running a Spartan obstacle course, weightlifting, HEMA swordfighting, taking or
        editing photos, reading Dune again, playing TTRPGs, driving on the LCC or conquering a hiking trail? </p>

    <p>But who knows what life brings next, honestly...</p>
