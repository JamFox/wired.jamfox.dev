## Wishlist

Cocktail kit, with 2 shakers

Meat thermometer

Steam [wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/JamFox/)

Nice mortar and pestle

Mise en place + sauce bottles - so I can finally organize my meal preps

Nice long, matte black, non see-through cup - something that feels nice to drink when there's tons of icecubes

French press + coffee grinder

Proper chef's knife

Weird or interesting food or drinks
