In Saue, Estonia a local man lost the lottery. The man, named Marek-Ein Kallap, had all of his hopes and dreams torn to pieces - quite like his ticket when he shredded it - when he lost out on a whopping 20203,30€!

He tried his luck on a sunny Sunday - as he always has been doing for years - by buying the latest Bingo lottery ticket from a local store. March 17th was the day when he forfeited some of his money in cash for two tickets.

"He's quite a sympathetic man, he comes here quite often. Shame that he didn't win, I guess… You know, I was sure he was gonna win it this time," said Marta Poolak, the local store's clerk.

Marek explained to us that he never buys from the internet - he does not trust virtual money.

"I think I lost because I didn't buy the damn tickets from the computer. Most of the past winners have been from the internetwebs. It must be rigged, I-I'm telling you!" exclaimed Marek during our interview following his great disappointment.

He was sitting on his leather couch with a slight tingle in his hands as he watched the show "The Great Lotto-Wednesday" live on March 20th. As the numbers came flying to the screen one by one the tingle in his hands turned into a violent shake, Marek described to us.

"The first two numbers were mine! I WAS SO CLOSE! But I fucking knew it was rigged when the third number didn't match mine. Man, those computers have ruined humanity…"

Be that as it may, lady luck did not smile to Marek that day.
