      <title><![CDATA[A Month of 2021 Quantified]]></title>
      <link>https://jamfox.dev/blog/month-of-2021-quantified/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Back in 2019 I did <a href="https://jamfox.dev/blog/january-2019-quantified/">a month of quantified self</a>, every activity was broadly tracked in 1 hour increments in a Google Sheet template I found on Reddit.</p>
        <p>It was interesting, but I didn't continue after that one month. Then came 2021, a year marked by my busiest semester ever, juggling many commitments with almost no room for a breather. So I did what anyone would logically do and added another commitment: I began meticulously tracking my time, not just in broad one-hour chunks but down to the very seconds, complete with categories and subcategories.</p>
        <p>For 27 days, from 2021-10-14 to 2021-11-10, I tracked every single second of my time with a total of 664 hours, 1 minute and 34 seconds of tracked time. I used <a href="https://toggl.com/track/">Toggl Track</a> to track my time and export the results.</p>
        <p>In terms of major commitments I was juggling:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>a half-time job as a sysadmin and DevOps engineer at a High Performance Computing center.</li>
        <li>a position as the president of Student Council of the School of IT.</li>
        <li>third semester of hardware development with a workload that was beyond the nominal ECTS requirements of a full-time student at TalTech.</li>
        <li>social life.</li>
        <li>working out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The whole idea was to answer a very common question I used to get at that time: &quot;just how do you manage all this without a burnout?&quot;</p>
        <p>Empirics help, but in essence I also did not know what to answer besides &quot;I just say yes to everything that seems interesting and also - sleep is paramount! ☝️🤓&quot; I mean yes, sleep is still paramount, even if you're not doing a stupid grindset like I was, in fact the amount of sleep one gets is in direct correlation with how much a they can do. But I will just copy-paste from the 2019 post: you can't learn from what you can't observe. Not that you would need to observe every second to be able to grow as a person, but in the long run it definitely did not hurt to have this data.</p>
        <p>So did it hurt in the short term? Weeeell... read on! In the last one I focused on raw numbers a lot since there was no real context to that time, my life was and had been quite the same for years, same school, same friends, same old. I focused a lot on my operational lifestyle. Played around with diets and fasting which led me to not get hangry and finding out I can actually focus <em>better</em> when hungry, it turns out my body is fine with starving as it can &quot;just eat later&quot;. I experimented with sleep schedules (including some lighter variants of polyphasic sleep), found out my sleep harmony was going to sleep around 1-2am and waking up at 9-10am. I tried studying methods, different ways and times of working out, meditating and all sorts of things: all in all my routines were pretty much set in stone and that gave me time to explore and identify the systems and living mechanisms that resonated most with my mind and body.</p>
        <p>It's a bit different for the mandatory military and uni years of turbulence, filled with significant changes in thought and lifestyle that put all of what I had learned and the brain itself through its paces.</p>
        <p>So with the following covers the surrounding years to give insight into how I ended up in the classic Estonian Workhorse Grindset™ and how I finally diverged from it.</p>
        <h3>2019 july - 2020 may</h3>
        <p>I had just found a new peace with myself after finally nurturing deep friendships and getting over the worst my avoidant attachment behavior and thought patterns. I thought I had more or less figured out who I was and what was the source of my confidence, not to mention all the newfound understanding of my mind and body. I was ready to open up myself to the world, express myself, stop consuming and start creating more. I felt like I could be driving force!</p>
        <p>The night before stepping on the bus that would take me to hell and back we shaved our heads with those that also had their own military service buses to catch (but their buses went to what seemed fun camps). It was only after all the fun photoshoots of ridiculous hairstyles before fully shaving that I realized how much of my outward expression I had lost. I looked at the bundle of hair in the bin while listening to the quiet brushing against my teeth after the loud shenanigans we had had minutes before. I glanced up and I can tell you that it wasn't just the depressant effects of the alcohol still in my blood that made my stomach drop. It just wasn't me anymore, I looked so cold without my hair, so unnatural, a little more aggressive.</p>
        <p>I thought it wasn't that bad the next morning, but I probably should have taken it as a sign of things to come. I had been told that I had a choice on which bus to step on since I had voluntarily signed up, yet when I arrived no such choice actually existed. Another sign.</p>
        <p>When I arrived I understood that they literally could not give a SINGLE FLYING FUCK about any one of us there. We were numbers in a sheet, these numbers already had a place picked out and there was no room for deviation. Each of us possessing very different qualities, knowledge, education, capabilities which could've been useful in so many different ways: reduced to uniform mass of muscle. It didn't matter that there were people in the crowd who knew what spoons were and where to get them, we were all there told to finish soup with knives.</p>
        <p>It's not just the inhumanity which we were treated with (both verbally and physically) which could be explained with keeping everyone in line (even though even maintaining discipline does not really justify how awful they were to the conscripts). It's the plain stupidity, laziness, and inefficiency that was driving me crazy. I'm not telling you to drive sustainable, green electric tanks to the front lines, I'm saying maybe it's not necessary to drive a whole convoy around 100+km to find a single lost magazine? Maybe it's not necessary to berate conscripts while they dig moss from between walkways that are cleaned by the cleaning company on the military's payroll anyway just because some higher up was bored?</p>
        <p>When you are so off the deep end that you can't not try to propose a better way of doing something you'll be put back in &quot;your place&quot; for doing the job of higher ups: thinking. No expression is allowed, a slight smirk was caught and treated as the sickness of deviation it is. Every single minute of free time was be filled with any random activity to suppress any kind of expression, even that of private and internal. Worst part is that it was effective, soon my peers were talking about nothing but stuff related to the service. It makes sense, like I said all of our time was thinking of or living the military life now, yet it made my unbelievably sad that each of my attempts to talk about <em>anything</em> else was met with a bounce back to whatever frustration they had that morning or similar.</p>
        <p>I tried my best to fill every single free second writing to myself, family or friends. But I realized my self was not enough, I needed a feedback to confirm I was not crazy, I needed signs that there were still with working brains and kind people somewhere where I wasn't, that I had somewhere to return to, and there was maybe some hope for me too.</p>
        <p>Those deep friendships I mentioned? Turns out that even if you have a lot to relate to with someone does not mean that they will be able to empathise with something that they can not relate to. Or that they will care to empathise? I got almost no support from most of the people I wrote to. After a while I stopped writing and calling almost altogether, no point sending messages into the void. As a result I became selfish and less caring. It was the most effective filter that showed me who really cared despite them not truly understanding the situation I was in. My mother and my best friend. Both of them female, they had no duty nor desire to join the military service, yet they were there for me. Not like many ladies in my life at the time they did not tell me to man up, to not make a big deal of something that was my duty as a man. They held me on my feet with their kindness, even when I lashed out at them from the crushing weights of my frustrations. They reminded not to lose myself. They reminded that my self could flourish once again if I held on, just as my hair would grow back.</p>
        <p>With mandatory military service came my second downfall of individuality (<a href="https://jamfox.dev/blog/a-diary-is-as-much-for-you/">after that of puberty</a>) and the taps of my expression were essentially screwed shut. My capabilities, intelligence, all that which I had been praised for years, suddenly all of it was reduced to nothing. All my expression was found as dangerous deviation to the military or annoying whining to most of whom I thought of as my friends. And my self? I just could not trust myself under all that pressure.</p>
        <p>During the last 3 months of the military service I lost most of my muscle, I lost weight, I lost all desire to create and express. I became an automata, just consuming media and games, just coasting through whatever orders I was handed. I was so boring and empty, it was insane, they had succeeded in making me a shell that was just sane enough to carry out orders.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We've been livin' in the flames, we've been eatin' up our brains.</p>
        <p>Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>All I lived for in this zombie state was the end date. And in this future oriented I was losing grasp on the present, I lived for the future. Always thinking of when was the next moment I could go to sleep, thinking of how many days it was until the end. Even during the weekends I was able to go home I couldn't really relax, my mind already started wandering to the misery that would await me in just a couple of days.</p>
        <h3>2020 summer</h3>
        <p>These shakes did not go on forever. Which led me to the summer of freedom. Which I spent in its entirety playing the Yakuza games. Played Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 and in the spirit of this post it feels relevant to mention that it took 143 hours of that summer, averaging around 1.6 hours a day. It became my daily escape and solace, safe space to immerse myself in.</p>
        <p>When I wasn't doing a round of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBKXk2VaOVA&amp;pp=ygURa2lyeXUgc2hvd2VyIG1lbWU%3D">Bakamitai karaoke</a> or doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joBlWV-SkUM">borderline insane heat actions</a> as Kiryu I noticed I had become more selfish, less kind, a lot less expressive as myself.</p>
        <p>I had become painfully aware of my insignificance and the true extent of the universes apathy. I had been told I was a genius, that I would do great things, that I would be useful. I felt like it was all a lie, that I had no place. I would be molded into a predestined shape that someone else had formed. Either I would fit through it or perish.</p>
        <p>I had no desire to socialize, talk to people, to go out of the house. I felt an &quot;order&quot; in everything people asked of me, reminding me of worse days, leading me having to exert extra will to not become annoyed when people asked small things of me. I was denying every sign of destiny, grasping for autonomy at every possible chance, trying to prove that I had at the very least <em>some</em> power over myself.</p>
        <p>I still did go out of the house. There were a couple of bigger birthdays, a longer hike with The Bois, and my friends still invited me to places occasionally even when I did not take initiative. The few times I did go out, I really felt how much worse my ability to form cohesive sentences was - not to mention stories or longer explanations. My ability to care, empathise, to notice what others were feeling had declined.</p>
        <p>I felt stuck in myself. Firstly, I had lost the &quot;why&quot; to expressing myself, then over time it seems I also lost a notable part of the &quot;how&quot;. Secondly, I felt like no-one cared to ask or listen. I hated it so much, I had to find an audience, I had to rediscover the &quot;why&quot;. But I was so wounded and exhausted that I just retreated back to playing videogames instead of working on it.</p>
        <h3>Rest of 2020 - 2021</h3>
        <p>From the moment the introductory campus orienteering event (and thus my first unofficial school day) was over I was overloaded with a newfound life force. All the students, freshmen and lecturers I had met, all the student organizations I had learned about, were all so full of life and hope... no, scratch that, it was <em>certainty</em> in a bright future and equally bright present.</p>
        <p>I felt that I could be a part of it, add my own piece to it, to find my audience, to find my &quot;why&quot; once more and through that the &quot;how&quot; too.</p>
        <p>Suddenly everything that so much as resembled an audience in any way, I was there to go above and beyond. I created and learned Overleaf just to be able to generate the most beautiful graphs and figures, to add &quot;created in LaTeX&quot; at the end of my math homeworks just because I knew that the lecturers would appreciate it. We created an extra &quot;advertisement&quot; video for a completely ridiculous and useless first robotics project that was not part of the grade and gave us &quot;nothing&quot; but the sparkle and respect in the eyes of the lecturers. I spent hours creating a pig mask that saw use only once for a Minecraft themed freshman orientation event. I spent time creating and maintaining a Discord server for our course so that we could share useful information and turn our frustrations into memes. I started going to every public event I could possibly. Everywhere I found an audience, I made sure to leave a mark. Everyone I could be of use to, I would be.</p>
        <p>And through all that I found new friends (from my course mostly), a new community (Student Council of the School of IT) to be part of every day. It was salvation, I found the joy of being around nice, intellectually and emotionally capable people again.</p>
        <p>People who <em>cared</em>!</p>
        <p>People who wanted to do things and not just to get things done but for the sake of itself. People who wanted to do things and not just to get things done but to get them done efficiently and in elegant methods.</p>
        <p>And they <em>cared</em>!</p>
        <p>They cared about what I had to say. They cared about what influence I wished to have. They cared about being a part of me.</p>
        <p>I was relearning what I was capable of, rediscovering the infinite possibilities I had of expressing myself, reexamining my selfishness and the source of it, taking apart my apathy, rebuilding my cynicism back into joy, relearning <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a1d2f34f-4700-4617-a309-a5de8bb393b2">The Power of Now</a>.</p>
        <p>It recontextualized my zombie state into something new - it was as if I was a rubber band that had been stretched to its limit and then released. <strong>I was flying at mach infinity, nothing could stop me!</strong></p>
        <p>Each semester I took more and more academic credits while maintaining a high enough average grade to warrant 2 stipends for 3 semesters straight. My shoulders could carry more! I accidentally fell into the best possible internship I could have wished for, even though I had no plan of working during uni years. I was elected as <a href="https://jamfox.dev/images/ITUK_Esimees_mottkiri_Turvas.pdf">the president of the IT Student Council</a>. I was developing personally, socially, academically, professionally and my life was full of things to say &quot;yes!!!&quot; to.</p>
        <p>Sidenote: my programme supervisor put a really nice looking Chekhov's gun on the wall of my future in the shape of a recommendation letter to CERN.</p>
        <p>And this was the time I decided to start tracking my time again. Just to capture this speed, unstoppable joy in time where things we so so <em>so</em> unbelievably good.</p>
        <p>Yet not all was rose colored. My patience, while juggling all these responsibilities and commitments, for example. I felt myself getting irritated when people weren't clear, efficient, getting straight to the point. Anytime I felt someone was wasting my time, I would fly off my handle and walk away if it was possible.</p>
        <p>Emptying out my to-do list became the leading force. Once again, in an entirely new way, I was losing the ability to focus on the present. I could not be truly present while there was something on the to-do list and it was constantly being filled with new things. What I really should've done is meditate more, to kind of &quot;clean up&quot; my thoughts. Instead I opted for movies to get lost in or gaming to get into that flow state, both of which were more like really satisfying <em>breaks</em> from the mountain of thoughts looming over me than actual solutions to doing something with the thoughts. But in the moments where my to-do list was empty, my will and discipline were so exhausted that I could not help myself.</p>
        <p>I become more jittery, more ADHD-like. I instantly thought of my daily tasks the second I woke up, causing me to forget dreams. It became a new reflex to do everything right away.</p>
        <p>I had lost myself in the other direction in an effort to prove that I had power, influence, autonomy to forge my own destiny, that I could smith my own molds.</p>
        <p>And to the sound of gunfire, the CERN recommendation letter materialized into an actual future: I would be going to work at CERN for the whole of 2022.</p>
        <p>I didn't realize it at the time, since I did not give myself the time to write, think or give my thoughts and self-analysis a more concrete shape that I could work with. It was when went out of my way to finish the semester early and christmas came. With it also the 2-week vacation from work. And the activity of ITÜK was frozen, since everyone was preparing from exams (that I had done ahead of time) and there were close to no student events.</p>
        <p>Overnight most of my commitments were wiped, the to-do list was blank. I had been given back all the time I had took from myself.</p>
        <h3>2022</h3>
        <p>After three semesters of finding audiences and doing something for <em>them</em> to prove <em>I</em> had autonomy over myself, I was alone in a new country and decided to swing right into the other extreme and focus all of my time on myself.</p>
        <p>France's culture gave me a friendly pat on the back and said &quot;la vie n'est pas faite pour travailler.&quot; It hit me how much Estonian culture itself had directed me towards and overly encouraged my maddeningly obsessive every-second-filled schedule. There was no-one to ask me &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;Could it be unhealthy?&quot;, I was only asked &quot;How do you do that? I wish I could be like you!&quot; Now I felt like the odd one out, an absolute maniac running around bumping into people just chilling, focusing on the joys of espresso and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLOfV2m3zV4">quaso~</a>.</p>
        <p>It rubbed off on me oh so good.</p>
        <p>I started writing again, working out, taking walks, cooking, just chilling in the park. Most crucially, I reconnected with the present.</p>
        <p>Besides that new cultures gave way to new perspectives on religion, philosophy. Foremost I understood the muslim world a lot better, giving me the chance to reflect on a past relationship and to recontextualize my empathy.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the world seems a lot smaller after the year at CERN. Me going there was hyped up to be as a huge thing. It was all so exaggerated that I really believed it too. &quot;That's it! I will do great things! I'll have the chance to eat and have coffee with gigabrain scientists and engineers! I'll live alone in a foreign country!&quot; I felt that I could taste the endgame of life.</p>
        <p>Now I understand that actually life is more or less the same everywhere. Old me, new location. New Person, Same Old Mistakes.</p>
        <p>Why I raved about this life in France was not because there were things here that are not available in Estonia, but that the same things were of better quality. You can go to adventure parks or go hiking, but it doesn't hold a candle to climbing in the Alps. Yet, no matter how much better things are, at its core it is the same. I don't know why I expected life elsewhere to be drastically different. On the one hand, it is actually liberating: I'll be fine anywhere. On the other hand, it's a bit disappointing too: is that all there is to it?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;You can change your external environment all you want, but you will continue to travel with the one box that will always accompany you.
        The box known as your mind.&quot;</p>
        <p>From <a href="https://moretothat.com/travel-is-no-cure-for-the-mind/">Travel Is No Cure for the Mind</a> by Lawrence Yeo</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Moving is a fantastic way to gain insight into unfamiliar cultures and illuminating ways of life, it is not a cure for discontentment of the mind. I mistook the The Box of Daily Experience to be the same as The Box of My Mind.</p>
        <p>In the past, I was very strongly motivated by the feeling that I was always preparing for some future. Middle school? In order to get to university. University? To get a job. What am I preparing for now? The present caught up with the future! In short, it felt like I had 'arrived', as it were. The only way forward was to go inward, not forward or upward.</p>
        <p>I have learned and grown, and this will never end, but I hit a point where I wished to find an outlet to my love, to my expression and endless curiosity. I wished to channel all that is me to the persons closest to me, community, my friends, partner. I no longer wanted the grind, or a one-way audience, I wanted a dialogue, dance partners. I wished to both give <em>and</em> take.</p>
        <h3>2023</h3>
        <p>Coming back I felt like I was watching the world in slow-motion. Once again I felt like the odd one out, but in the opposite way. Estonia was full of maniacs running around restlessly and I no longer felt the desire to be part of this madness.</p>
        <p>I've been walking around with a heightened awareness of my self and my surroundings. I try to notice my instincts to weed out the jitter of the remains of my needless ambition. I <strong>do less</strong> across the board, for that I am calmer, I say &quot;no&quot; more and focus on the little things instead. I spend <em>a lot</em> more time writing and reflecting.</p>
        <p>I've started a war of hugs against productivity in its traditional sense. Eating, hanging out with friends, just sitting and looking around, making love is all productive. I hope that I embody that sentiment and give people the chance to see it that way too.</p>
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>And this is where we get to the numbers part of this quantified self post. The following is the analysis from a month in the aforementioned busiest semester of my life from 2021.</p>
        <h3>Commute</h3>
        <p>Commuting took 3.78 hours per week on average. Most of it was driving from home to school/work and back, which was a 14 km one way by car. By car it took me 10-20 minutes one way depending on the traffic conditions, 12 minutes on average.</p>
        <p>On the other hand: by train and foot it took me 1 hour and 3 minutes one way. So 6-3 times longer! Going by this, using the worse estimation, if I had not used the car, I would've spent 11.34 hours per week on commuting. And this is not accounting for the time waiting and planning the route which also adds some time.</p>
        <p>It's not that commuting by public transport is worse by default because it takes longer. That time can technically be used better than the time in the car, since it requires no active focus. It is a choice between freedom of time and freedom of utility. With the car all unnecessary time is shaved off, there is no planning or waiting required, hop in and go. On the other hand, public transport allows for taking an actual break or to use the time to catch up with friends, read a book etc, and is better for slowing the mind. Yet the lack of freedom and requirement to operate on the schedule of the train creates slight yet noticeable stress. By driving a car, I save myself time and thought. The train obliges me to fill the time, car gives me freedom to choose.</p>
        <h3>Work (HPC)</h3>
        <p>Gotta give credit to the absolutely wonderful boss and collective at the HPC for giving me the chance to organize the work methods and worked time however I wanted. Being the largest of the commitments in time per week, being so flexible was paramount to organizing everything.</p>
        <p>Quite sad that it's not the norm, but the chill and flexible environment really did allow me to focus on work when it mattered the most. Having to grind hours with nothing to do as is the norm in many places would've been a real wrench in the works for me. Being able to take a nap in the office couch and the fact that it was actually encouraged shows how much respect, empathy and insight the boss has.</p>
        <h3>Student Council of the School of IT (ITÜK)</h3>
        <p>3.86 hours of work per week, surprisingly little, but that was at a period where the chaos of the fall semester had died down and there was a lot less to do.</p>
        <p>With a bit more breathing room in my council schedule, I decided to accept an invitation to brainstorm ideas for the upcoming IT building. To make this process smoother, I arranged visits to the Tartu Delta and EKA buildings, enlisting the help of individuals well-acquainted with these spaces. Their insights revealed a number of ideas, including potential pitfalls, accidental successes, and the preferences of those utilizing these areas.</p>
        <p>AND close to 34 hours of socializing time was from ITÜK, easily at the top of the list of socializing time spent. Here's where categorizing was a little difficult, because technically being present, networking, and socializing was also a part of the job.</p>
        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>That semester I took 42 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) academic credits. Note that 1 ECTS is supposed to be 26h of work (it never is that much, but whatever), which means 42 ECTS should in principle total around 1092 hours over the course of 16 weeks. Taking that into account it should've resulted in more or less 68.25 hours spent on school per week.</p>
        <p>I totalled 12.31 hours per week during the time of my tracking period: a miniscule 18% of the expected workload! Not sure if this says more about my abilities to optimize the absolute living daylight out of the programme or the lacking programme itself.</p>
        <p>Worth noting that during tracking I was doing a a considerable amount of catching up in order to realign with my schedule after the typically hectic and social first half of the semester during which I had put off some schoolwork until later. I would expect the total semester average to be even lower since it was a busier period for school during the tracking, but no actual data to back that up.</p>
        <h3>Self</h3>
        <p>The Self category is about the time directed towards and for myself.</p>
        <h4>Entertainment</h4>
        <p>Passive media took in total. Of which movies was 15.25 hours, theatre 5 hours, shows 2 hours, anime 1.3 hours, reading only 18 minutes. Just scrolling the web, Reddit, YouTube took almost 69 hours, easily the largest time sink.</p>
        <p>Read 1 book: &quot;Paradoxes&quot; by Enn Kasak. I did not finish this during the tracking, continued reading it after the tracking period.</p>
        <p>Saw 2 plays:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Fairy Tale Arch (Elina Masing @ Kanuti Gildi SAAL)</li>
        <li>The Master and Margarita (@ Vene Teater)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Watched 11 movies:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Burning</li>

        <p>Active media took 22.5 hours in the form of gaming.</p>
        <p>Played 3 games:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Battlefield 4</li>
        <li>Deep Rock Galactic</li>
        <li>Star Wars: Fallen Order</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Operational time</h4>
        <p>Operational maintenance describes the ongoing effort required to keep living and it bit close to 37 hours from the schedule. This consists of time maintaining physical and mental health. So anything from eating, showering to task management and meditating.</p>
        <p>During tracking I had 3 meditation sessions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>43 minutes walking the dog</li>
        <li>5 and 3 minutes focusing on breathing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Operational improvement describes time spent setting up or smoothing the processes of operational maintenance and that took 3.5 hours.</p>
        <h4>Creative</h4>
        <p>The only time spent actually creating something for myself was editing photos for 3.75 hours.</p>
        <p>Sad :(</p>
        <p>I did not realize at the time, but looking back it would've been so nice for myself to focus more on expression.</p>
        <h3>Sleep</h3>
        <p>During the time of tracking the average daily sleep was 8.5 hours. Longest being 10 hours and shortest being 6.3 hours.</p>
        <p>Sleep was probably the single most important factor in being able to keep all this up for the whole semester:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I could not have afforded getting sick.</li>
        <li>It would not have been possible for me to context switch and focus on everything as efficiently.</li>
        <li><em>Everything</em> is worse on a lack of sleep and my moods would have taken an especially hard hit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Social</h3>
        <p>Most of my time socializing was spent with ITÜK, close to 34 hours + 4.5 hours with the ITÜK board. The next largest was with friends, 29 hours to which can also be added time spent with The Bois, 9.5 hours.</p>
        <p>I would've wanted to hang with The Bois more than 2 times during the tracking month, but such is the pain of trying to fit together the schedules of 5 adult people during uni years. Which actually lead to me spending most of my socializing within ITÜK. Being so active in (as to become the president of the board) ITÜK was my way of trying to find and build my community and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third place</a> as it were. Funnily that was both the best and worst place to find a tight-knit community. Obviously I did find my place there and had a wonderful time there, but the nature of this particular organization is that the member activity period is very short by nature, 1-2 years. Best in short term, worst in the long term when everyone had moved on, gotten a job, or graduated. Every year there is a little over 100 new interested members, a huge influx of new faces and little by little they drown out the older circles. Older circles which wither or find a new place outside the organization. But what I got from it was a sense of what a community <em>could be</em>. I was surrounded by people who really cared about making a difference and doing things properly. The rest of the board handled their duties with such care and effort that I almost never had to keep my fingers on their pulse, we could all rely on each other and trust that promises would be kept and disasters would be worked through together.</p>
        <p>With family I spent 16 hours.</p>
        <p>Digital socializing consisted of 14.5 hours on the phone and 1 hour on e-mail. All in all that is 92.5 hours socializing in person and and 15.5 digitally.</p>
        <h3>Workout</h3>
        <p>Managed to make it to gym 5 times over the course of 27 tracked days and had no time to run (probably no desire either considering the weather during fall).</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>A diary, <a href="https://attainablefelicity.mattkirkland.com/20230822/Sketchbooks.html">sketchbook</a>, Notion/Obsidian, Remarkable or whatever have you. <a href="https://moretothat.com/the-problem-with-note-taking/">A way to remember</a>, reign in the inner dialogue, detangle the messy thought threads. Writing <em>is</em> thinking, how one makes sense of life, how one expounds their world - but above all I realized, <strong>writing is sharing</strong>.</p>
        <p>Language is like a trade between being understandable to others and binding our ways of thinking (like how many words for truth in Russia changes how one thinks about truth as in <a href="https://brain.jamfox.dev/Evaluation-of-Russia-by-finnish-intelligence-colonel">Evaluation of Russia by finnish intelligence colonel</a>, or the understanding of absence and space in Japan and the relativism of &quot;individuals&quot; explored in <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/96a92731-6759-44bb-b7d0-6924f5df84d3">How the World Thinks</a>). Putting thoughts into words does give thoughts a more manageable <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/arrival-2016/">&quot;shape&quot;</a> if you will. But in the first place, you kind of have to force it into that shape. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-square-hole">&quot;And the triangle goes...? Into the square hole!&quot;</a> At the same time it both frees us by the way of expression and restricts us by the way of the language structure. Yet there is no alternative, as the hardcoded desire for socializing will compel us to express ourselves.</p>
        <p>And the question is to what extent to we wish to express ourselves and why is it so hard to just that. Not even hard in the way of &quot;what words in what order would convey what I wish to get across?&quot; Through trauma and experiences we develop schemas, modus operandis, styles of forming relationships (<a href="https://brain.jamfox.dev/Key-to-Writing-Criminally-Good-Relationships">Key to Writing Criminally Good Relationships</a> and <a href="https://brain.jamfox.dev/Limerence">Limerence</a>) that may go unexamined, unseen and develop into layers of personas (<a href="https://brain.jamfox.dev/Carl-Jung">Carl Jung</a>) that we will use to socialize. How many layers even exist? And who gets to see how deep?</p>
        <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/-BLAUhBl0nA?si=TEkVOlwzwNFgD2XK&amp;t=1124">Everything Is Television by Solar Sands</a> it is proposed that there are four levels of understanding:</p>

        <li>You understand that the person across from you has the capacity to think in the same way as you. You feel and think so you know they must feel and think. Both given the same information may come to the same conclusions.</li>
        <li>You understand that who you are trying to understand has different life experiences, so given the same information you will come to different conclusions because of that difference in experience.</li>
        <li>You understand that someone with (roughly) the same life experiences may still not think the same way as you. Their moral foundations, the way their brain is wired, personality may lean in completely different directions. You realize that there is no actual &quot;universally shared experience&quot;.</li>
        <li>You understand that even after accounting for personality, morals, memories, genetics and an endless myriad of other conscious and physical variables, there still are an uncountable unconscious and subconscious variables that make it essentially hopeless to really <em>understand</em> and <em>see</em> anyone.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Even if it is hopeless to understand others, can we understand ourselves? When self-deception (<a href="https://brain.jamfox.dev/This-is-not-who-I-am/">This is not who I am</a>) and deep rooted almost invisible traumas, with self-awareness requiring so much perseverance and energy that we've made religions out of it?</p>
        <p>I can say with confidence that in us all lies a desire to be understood, to be seen, to be significant to at least a single other person. At the same time it is always at odds with our inability to understand and see not only others but ourselves. &quot;I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me.&quot; However hopeless, we can't live without others.</p>
        <p>I feel like writing a diary, journaling, sketchbooking is the closest we come to understanding ourselves. Where we actually give shape to the parts that would otherwise be chaotic vague floaty thoughts. However it is almost always with the asterisk of &quot;it is only for me, NOT for sharing.&quot; And usually not for sharing to be able to keep it honest and unfiltered. It was like a sudden spotlight was turned to another one of those inconspicuous, so-normal-that-you-don't-notice-it-being-there, matured, set-in-stone, &quot;all done&quot; labeled premise/assumption/axiom when I asked a dear friend of mine &quot;why do you keep a diary?&quot; and their first answer was &quot;because I hope someone will read it.&quot; It makes no sense, yet all the sense at the same time. Leaving aside the impracticality of getting to know someone through reading their diary and the problems that come with it, I still think the premise is both touching and important: that after all, we do want to be understood!</p>
        <p>Being alone is worse than not being understood which is why <a href="https://moretothat.com/the-problem-of-what-others-think/">a gap emerges between who you are, and who you are presenting</a>. But beyond that, isn't there a desire to not have that gap? To find someone you could present yourself to honestly and without filters? Someone you could share your diary with in a way where you don't have to think about filtering?</p>
        <p>I assume for most the filters would follow the order of:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>self, blobby mess of thoughts and feelings - no filter (?).</li>
        <li>diary language filter - thoughts as honest as the language allows not accounting for self-deception.</li>
        <li>close friends and family filter - thoughts honest as the language allows, but with parts omitted.</li>
        <li>interested-but-not-yet-friends filter - may or may not be honest, with many parts omitted.</li>
        <li>strangers filter - probably a separate persona, with some semblance of honesty.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>But why stop at the third filter? Don't we want to lay it all bare for those we hold dear?</p>

        <h2>Karl Conscious Era</h2>
        <p>For my unconscious era (KBCE, the Karl Before Conscious Era, is counted from birth up to 11 years old) I was a jolly little dude with almost no boundaries. Not bothering myself with the opinions of others. If I was curious, nothing would stop me from asking even the most coldest dangerous looking guy at an Eastern Europe bus station about how he thought it was possible that such big things as planes could possibly fly. If I wanted to show up at a classical concert with winter pants (because they almost looked like shuffle dance pants) and dance shuffle with headphones on during the intermission then I would do just that. I would give in to all of my whims and hyperfocused obsessions. I did not care at all: I had my parents who supported all of what I did and was interested in. I had my friends that each shared something with at least one of my obsessions. And if they or anyone else did not understand me then that did not matter as I was the center of the universe.</p>
        <p>Yet with puberty came Consciousness. And with it The Questions of Life (KCE, the Karl Conscious Era, is counted from the age of 12 years old and forward).</p>
        <p>&quot;I am me. Who am I?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;It feels like I have a purpose. What is my purpose?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I want to understand myself and be understood. How can I be understood?&quot;</p>
        <p>Yet at that age of puberty, it is impossible to understand one's self, to even begin to answer these questions. They weren't even questions at that time, more like some vague floaty feelings and semi-related thought-loops that came to bother me from time to time.</p>
        <p>So deep down I wanted to be understood, yet doesn't that seem at odds with my own inability to even comprehend these same questions? How would anyone possibly understand me if I myself didn't? Compounded by the very real chance that everyone else was in one way or another wrestling with the same exact questions.</p>
        <p>Puberty is a funky time for all involved. A time where everyone wants to be noticed, understood and loved. Yet! No-one really has any attention to look beyond themselves, any capacity to understand anyone else than themselves, and no love to give just our own gaping holes in the heart to fill. It's like everyone's frantically running around asking for things they themselves can't give.</p>
        <p>The more I pondered who I really was, the more I leaned towards not wanting to be just me. I wanted to be a friend, a child, a lover. To be myself through others, in relation to others, not just myself. I did not want to be the universe, I wanted to be a part of one now.</p>
        <p>Of course I still carried my carefree momentum into the KCE, yet with the mess of puberty and nasty hormones all over the place it seemed to bite me in the ass. I had been carefree because I had had my needs met. With the new need of wanting to be understood came the compromises, because now I cared. Following my whims was not enough, I wanted others to accept and understand them.</p>
        <p>Just as I wanted to be understood, but was at my capacity just by trying to understand myself, so was everyone else. And oh how painful that was, to get slapped on the wrist (both figuratively by peers, and literally on occasions by teachers) for following my whims, doing what I thought was normal. For each slap I got, I knew to keep that interest, thought, way of doing things to myself. And it was not miserable, mind you! Quite the opposite, as the more I held myself back, the more acceptance I found. I developed my Outward Persona. I was happy to meet my social needs by the way of my Persona and pursue my interests in isolation.</p>
        <p>It was not that anybody had abused the trust I had showed. It was that parts of my self that had been dismissed again and again. I began collecting thoughts and ideas of things that fascinated and interested me. For myself, but also because I was waiting for someone to care.</p>
        <p>I coasted through a lot of my KCE with an Outward Persona and an Inward Persona. It was pretty smooth sailing until at the age of 16 I was threatened with the wonderful experience of real romantic interest. &quot;He was a boy, she was a girl. Can I make it any more obvious?&quot; I had a crush, and it was mutual. And that meant they were interested in me? &quot;Saviour to break free of the false acceptance and repressed part of your self!&quot; you would think? Well... after having repressed much of myself for such a long time, it just did not feel real that someone would accept all of what made up the Inward Persona. I had kind of given up on that thought so I guessed that meant they were in love with the Outward Persona. So I started shoving the Inward Persona even further down the hole so as not to jeopardize the relationship. Even better: at the same time I started fostering resentment for their lack of ability to also see and appreciate the Inward Persona... that I hadn't even showed them.</p>
        <p>Stop here and bask in the sweet sweet irony of that thought process... Truly a masterpiece of a main dish with the umami trinity of self-deceptive thought processes, garnished with helpless destruction.</p>
        <p>Your shadow will always follow where you go. No matter how and where you stand in relation to lights, or how many lights you set up around you, the shadow will be there. Right under your feet, or between your wrinkles. Even if you could, you couldn't stay at the studio with your perfectly set up lighting anyway. So the solution to hiding my Inward Persona was to break off any relationship that came close to seeing through the cracks of the Outward one. In my effort to &quot;not jeopardize the relationship&quot; I did not only that, but even worse. I had showed love and interest, then started avoiding it. Viscera cleanup and healing the wound of an actual stab in the back would have probably been faster and less painful.</p>
        <p>After I found some actual friends that I could connect with on deeper levels I began breaking the lines between the Inward and Outward. I am particularly grateful to a friend who more or less forcefully started dragging the Inward Persona out, bit by bit. But I still lean towards waiting for active interest rather than grabbing interest. I accommodate, ask and listen, waiting for someone to do the same, for it to be mutual before I open up. I love myself, I think I am interesting but I always run the calculations about whether or not someone truly cares.</p>
        <p>A lot of my whims and ideas still find themselves expressed in my own mind, my notes. Never broadcasted, but also not not shared. Exactly like how my blog can't be found on the main pages: it is public, but not easily findable unless I share it or someone really goes out of their way to dig through the source code. I still wait for someone to ask, because at the baseline I still first assume that no-one cares <em>and then</em> hope that someone would.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>I realize that my self is a diary that I hope I can share with others.</p>
        <p><strong>Writing is sharing.</strong></p>

      <title><![CDATA[Orchestration Fundamentals Explained Simply]]></title>
      <link>https://jamfox.dev/blog/orchestration-explained/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>At some point, when I first started my path down the journey of DevOps and managing IT infrastructure at enterprise level, my team was tasked with deploying a containerized web app for storing documents. Catch being that no-one on the team knew anything about running containerized applications. But no problem!</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Working in IT is all about being able to new problems, so we'll learn on the job!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Nothing wrong with this approach if given sufficient time, but when you're told to deploy in a month? That's when you dive right in and find yourself in the middle of all kinds of magical words like: microservices, service meshes, service-level fault isolation, interoperability, container orchestration, horizontal scalability, service observability and discovery etc. So in the end you're sitting there with fire and explosions going off all around saying &quot;we're learning on the job, this is fine!&quot;</p>
        <p>My goal here is to provide not a very technical, easy to understand overview of what it means to go from a standard monolithic all-batteries-included app running on bare metal host to an orchestrated containerized app following the microservice architecture. This is the overview I wish I got before I jumped into the fire described earlier.</p>
        <h2>Meet The Monolith</h2>
        <p>Let's set the stage: say that me and you work for some company. The company's motivation is to make more money, that means reducing operating costs which in itself means making the tasks of the employees easier and more efficient. That is to say that <strong>our goal is to make our jobs as easy and efficient as possible</strong>. At first, this company was still using faxes and all the accounting was done on paper. But we built this wonderful web app for storing the companies documents (called Document Webapp) so the company can stop renting a whole warehouse for storing and handling physical stacks of paper. For the Document Webapp there was no other product that fit our company so we coded it ourselves in your favorite programming language. We ended up with a single executable that we test on the Test Server and run on the Production Server. Both servers are identical and run the same OS (let's call it the OldOS 1), same everything to ensure that there are no surprises, because when the intern tried to run it on his laptop with a different OS he got a lot of weird errors.</p>
        <p>By building this Document Webapp we reduced the costs by making the tasks of the employees easier and more efficient. But now instead of all the people at the document warehouse, we are managing the Document Webapp. We don't have to do as much work as all the people handling the paper did combined, but it's a lot of work to manage the Document Webapp so we would like to make OUR jobs easier and more efficient, so let's see what we could do.</p>
        <p>Let's look at the Document Webapp in detail. Because it's a web app it is using our companies load balancers (also acting as reverse proxies) so users can access it from the internet, fortunately load balancers are separate from our app and are taken care for us. But we coded our own:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Web front-end</li>
        <li>Document Database (to store our documents)</li>
        <li>Document Search (so clients can search for documents without scrolling through a list of them)</li>
        <li>Document Caching (so the documents are delivered efficiently to clients)</li>
        <li>Authentication System (to provide logins and private documents for clients)</li>
        <li>Web back-end (to tie all the previous systems together)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And <strong>the components of the app run inside that one executable</strong>!</p>
        <p>When we want to run a new version the the Document Webapp here's our deployment process at this point:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>SSH into the Test server</li>
        <li>Stop the Document Webapp</li>
        <li>Clone and build the latest Document Webapp</li>
        <li>Update the system packages if needed</li>
        <li>Start the new Document Webapp</li>
        <li>Repeat the same in the Production Server</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Quite simple! But we can automate that, so we run the same steps with Ansible. Even better! Now our process looks like this:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Update Ansible repository with the version of the Document Webapp and version of the system dependencies we want to deploy</li>
        <li>Ansible runs the following automatically on the Test server:
        <ol>
        <li>Stop the Document Webapp</li>
        <li>Clone and build the latest Document Webapp</li>
        <li>Update the system packages if needed</li>
        <li>Start the new Document Webapp</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat the same for Production Server</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By doing all this, manually or with Ansible, <strong>the application is tied to the host that we run it on <em>and</em> the hosts OS</strong>. That is to say, if the OS or the hardware of the host has issues then our app will also be affected. Transferring the app to a new host means adding a new host in Ansible with the same OS and letting Ansible configure it with our dependencies and the Document Webapp.</p>
        <h2>Meet The Container</h2>
        <p>Then one day, it turns out we need to upgrade all our servers' OS from OldOS 1 to OldOS 2 because the previous version is now no longer supported and does no longer get security patches. Remember when our intern tried to run the Document Webapp on his laptop with a different OS got a lot of weird errors? Well now we are facing the same problem, because the application is tied to the OS. But can we somehow isolate Document Webapp so that it is able to run on any machine? The answer is application containers!</p>
        <p>Containerization is having the operating system take features and properties normally considered global, and reduce them to private versions or limited access/resources as a means of restricting or isolating access to those resources. Note that it's not the same as running another virtual machine (VM). <strong>VMs isolate on the kernel level, containers isolate on the OS level</strong>. Furthermore, there is a difference between system containers and application containers. System containers take the place of VMs when there is no need to isolate on the kernel level, because they have less overhead because of not having to simulate the kernel. System containers are usually used as you would use a VM. However <strong>application containers are designed to only run a single process</strong> and only contain bare minimum of the OS dependencies that the said singular process needs. Application containers are designed to be treated as you would treat the executable without containerization. You're not supposed to remote into the container, run commands and install stuff in the container, they're not supposed to have their own IP address etc. If you need to modify the container, you stop the old one and launch a new one with the modified contents. To put it simply <strong>application containers are emphemeral</strong> and <strong>system containers (like VMs) are long-lasting</strong>.</p>
        <p>But we are storing documents on our app, how can it be ephemeral? <strong>We certainly do not want the data to be ephemeral</strong>, otherwise on each restart of the container we would lose our data! This is key point to understand: <strong>application containers need to be provided with a separate persistent storage that is not part of the container itself</strong>. Simplest solution is to mount a directory from the host into the container. So on each restart the container uses the same data directory and our data is long-lasting while our container is ephemeral!</p>
        <p>Going forward if I mention containers, I mean application containers not system containers.</p>
        <p>So we create our container image for our Document Webapp. After creating the container image and launching a container with that image we will have it running on the servers with OldOS 2 inside a container that runs the Document Webapp executable with only the bare minimum dependencies from OldOS 1. In fact if the intern tries to run the Document Webapp now, then using the container they will not have any problems with their OS! <strong>With the container we have isolated the app from the OS of the host we are running it on</strong>.</p>
        <p>Now our process looks like this:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Update Ansible repository with the version of the Document Webapp container image we want to deploy</li>
        <li>Ansible runs the following automatically on the Test server:
        <ol>
        <li>Stop the old Document Webapp container</li>
        <li>Start the new Document Webapp container</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat the same for Production Server</li>
        </ol>
        <p>At this point <strong>the containerized app is still dependent on the host we are running it on</strong> though! If there are issues on the hosts OS then our app will not be affected (unless it's serious), but if the hardware of the host has issues then our app will still be affected.</p>
        <h2>Meet The Orchestrator</h2>
        <p>Then at some point the Test server dies and it becomes the center of attention because what if this were to happen to Production? Management and we want to make sure that this absolutely does not happen to the Production Server. We could run a couple more Production servers for high availability and have a load balancer in front of them. This is certainly a good solution, but adds management overhead since now we have to manage multiple servers. Since we are already using containers, let's use an orchestrator!</p>
        <p>With an orchestrator we can set up a number of hosts in a cluster and then specify how many instances should be running and how these instances should be running and the orchestrator will take care of everything. However this comes with some new challenges as now where the Document Webapp is running becomes dynamic. The orchestrator will decide on it's own where it wants to run it and where it is the most efficient.</p>
        <p>Where the services are running, which port they are running on will all be dynamic with an orchestrator. The dynamic nature of orchestrating means we have to adapt our thinking and infrastructure to handle everything being dynamic. This means figuring out how to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>load balance and direct traffic to the services (often called ingress): how do we direct traffic to instance(s) of our service if we don't know the host it is running on?</li>
        <li>handle logging and aggregating logs for easier debugging: how do we know which instance had a problem, how do we know it was the orchestrator, where are all the logs located?</li>
        <li>manage TLS certificates: it is not possible or good practice to spam certificate requests for all nodes, how do we distribute them?</li>
        <li>cluster internal communication: if services are running on arbitrary ports, how can they communicate with each other?</li>
        <li>handle stateful storage: if the service can run on any host, how do we ensure it will always have the same data?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are non-trivial obstacles, but once solved the Document Webapp <strong>service(s) can be separated from the host(s) it is running on with an orchestrator</strong>. It will no longer matter where it is, the orchestrator will make sure the defined number of instances will be up if enough nodes in the cluster are alive. If one dies with a service running on it, the orchestrator will deploy a new instance on another host et voila, it's as easy as that!</p>
        <p>Now our process looks like this:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Define to the orchestrator how Document Webapp should be run and how many instances should be deployed</li>
        <li>Orchestrator will compare current state to defined state and do the following:
        <ol>
        <li>Check version and do a rolling update if current is outdated</li>
        <li>Check how many instances are running, stops or starts new instances to match defined state</li>
        <li>Takes care of load balancing, storage, certs</li>
        <li>Reports health of defined services</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The orchestrator will get us as close to true Infrastructure as Code as today's technology allows. At this point <strong>the containerized app is no longer dependent on any particular host(s) or any OS.</strong></p>
        <h2>Bonus: Meet The Microservices</h2>
        <p>With orchestration as the last step we have surpassed the most critical and hardest parts of deploying the Document Webapp. However if we wish to give it a final cherry on top we should move to the modern microservices architecture.</p>
        <p>Before we looked how our app consisted of multiple components that are all part of one executable:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Web front-end</li>
        <li>Document Database (to store our documents)</li>
        <li>Document Search (so clients can search for documents without scrolling through a list of them)</li>
        <li>Document Caching (so the documents are delivered efficiently to clients)</li>
        <li>Authentication System (to provide logins and private documents for clients)</li>
        <li>Web back-end (to tie all the previous systems together)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we update one of these components, we need to redeploy the whole app. To minimize downtime we should break these components apart into separate services. That way we can update and manage each of them separately. This has the added benefit of always being able to easily switch out the components provided that our application's interfaces were coded to support this instead of being stuck with the built-in solution for eternity.</p>
        <p>Breaking up applications comes with the drawback of having more complicated architecture. Designing components to be pluggable and dynamic will inherently be more complex and also complicates debugging, but it will provide the value of being very flexible as technologies change and evolve.</p>
        <h2>Recap</h2>
        <p>To put it very short:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Containers</strong> separate service(s) from the host OS</li>
        <li><strong>Orchestrators</strong> separate service(s) from hosts themselves</li>
        <li><strong>Microservice architecture</strong> allows service's components to be more flexible in terms of managing and deployment</li>
        </ul>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>20. sajand tõi inimkonnale peale hüppelise tehnika arengu ka ootusärevuse. See ärevus täitis pead mõtetega sellest, kuhu selline areng viia võiks ning millistesse kõrgustesse võiksid inimeste võimed tõusta. Nüüd on aga tekkinud küsimus, kas see areng on inimeste võimeid tõstnud või hoopis vastupidi.</p>
        <p>Tehnoloogia arengu eesmärgiks on alati olnud mugavus. Kauged eelkäijad avastasid, et kiviga on kookospähkleid mugavam avada kui kätega. Tänapäeval on probleemid täiesti erinevad, kuid eesmärk on jäänud samaks - teha inimeste elu lihtsamaks. Kuid Yuval Noah Harari toob oma teoses &quot;Sapiens&quot; välja tendentsi, mis käib tehnika arenguga kaasas - algselt on uued tehnoloogiad kõigest luksused, kuid ajapikku saavad need vajadusteks. Kunagi olid külmkapid vaid rikastele kättesaadavad, nüüd on need põhimõtteliselt igas kodus ning sõltutakse neist toidu säilitamisel. Seega tehnika teeb elu mugavaks paljude oskuste ja teadmiste arvelt pannes inimesi sõltuma nendest mugavustest.</p>
        <p>Tänapäevaks on tehnoloogia rikkamates riikides hõlbustanud või asendanud pea kõik, mis nõuab füüsilist pingutust. Tehastes on robotid, aukude kaevamiseks on ekskavaatorid, liikumiseks autod ning meelelahutuse saab otse koduselt ekraanilt - ehk otsene vajadus tervislikule eluviisile on kadumas. Mõni aasta tagasi võis &quot;Wall-E&quot; abitult tooli naelutatud tegelaste üle naerda, kuid nüüdseks on massiline ülekaalulisus saanud Ameerikale kriitiliseks. Asja muudavad täbaramaks ka teadlaste leiud, mis näitavad, et füüsiline tervis on väga tihedalt seotud ka vaimse tervise ja võimekusega.</p>
        <p>Lisaks on see mugavus tulnud ka suhtlemise arvelt. Poed on kaotamas teenindajaid, sest iseteenindus on saamas uueks tavaks ning varsti kaotavad taksojuhid oma töö robotautodele. Lisaks reklaamis paar aastat tagasi Google tehisintellekti, kes suutis automaatselt helistada juuksurile ning panna sinna aja pettes täieslikult toru teises otsas olevat inimest. Pealtnäha teevad need inimese elu paremaks, kuid see vähendab märgatavalt kokkupuudet inimestega, seejuures kaotades võime inimestest aru saada. Nii võivad inimesed muutuda Martin Scorsese filmi &quot;Taksojuht&quot; peategelase sarnaseks - isekaks ja teistest täiesti võõraks. Sarnane situatsioon on toimumas Jaapanis, kus hikikomoride arvuline tõus on tekitanud iibekriisi ning see on näide sellest, et ekraanid ei suuda siiski päriselt inimsuhtlust asendada.</p>
        <p>Võiks siiski loota, et tehnoloogia on andnud inimestele rohkem vaba aega ning vaimseid ressursse ning teinud sellega võimalikuks Oscar Wilde unistuse individualismi arengust. Nüüd, kus Maslowi püramiidi põhivajdused on täidetud, peaks igaüks saama keskenduda oma tegevustele ning ennast teostades ka inimkonda edasi viia. Meelelahutuse kättesaadavus on aga esile toonud vastupidise. Nimelt on eneseteostus ja sellega kaasnev pikaajaline rahulolu asendumas meelelahutuse ja selle lühiajaliste mõnudega, just nagu Aldous Huxley &quot;Heas uues ilmas&quot; kujutas. See aga aheldab inimeste mõttevõimet ning eneseväljenduslikke oskusi orwelliku uuskeele tasemeni. Näib, et mõne aja pärast peavad masinad peale andmesäilituse ja -töötluse ka teised vaimsed ülesanded inimeste asemel ära tegema.</p>
        <p>Seega on tehnoloogia eesmärk muutunud inimeste abistamisest inimeste asendamisele. Tehnoloogia areneb aina kiiremini edasi, kuid inimeste areng on pigem stagneerunud või isegi taandarengusse sattunud. Tehnika arengul on suured eelised, kui neid õigesti ära kasutada, kuid peab jälgima, et tehnika inimkonda ära ei asendaks.</p>
        <h2>Kommentaare aastast 2022</h2>
        <p>Siin ta on oma autentseimas originaalvormis oma komavigade, kohmakate sõnastuste ning kõige muuga, mis käib ajapiiranguga endale tähtsat kirjandi kirjutamisega kaasas. Mitte, et oleksin kartnud oma tuleviku pärast seda kirjutades. Pigem oli mulle tähtis näidata endale ja oma kallile õpetajale, kui kaugele ma tulnud olen keskaeelse ajaga võrreldes. See oli ikkagi tema, kes pani märkimisväärse aluse minu huvile korrektse, huvitava ja sisuga eneseväljenduse vastu ning see oli ikkagi minu viimane ametlik hindega kirjand. Tuleb välja, et kui sa saad täpselt selle teema, millest oleksid suuteline jahuma 0 ettevalmistusega tunnise ettekande, siis selle kirjasõnadesse panemine on ikka pisut keerukam. Võitlesin selle mustandiga liiga kaua. &quot;Mida välja jätta? Mida juurde lisada? Neid teemasid on siin juba liiga palju, miks kurat ma nii laiali läksin sellega? Oleks ju võinud ühe teemaga süvitsi minna? Kurat juba hilja, nüüd pean juba mustandiga alustama.&quot; Tulemuseks oli siiski jack of all trades tüüpi kirjutis, kus iga teema sai liialt põgusa ja ebapiisavate selgitustega kohmaka ülevaate.</p>
        <p>Tulemus: 77 punkti. Ilus number, aga tegelikult on see hinnang minu arvates liiga helde. Ma arvan, et hindaja nägi siin rohkem selle kirjandi kogupotentsiaali kui paberile jõudnut ennast. Mulle näib see puhtand rohkem mustandi nägu, millest tegelikult saaks vaeva nähes üsna okei kirjandi.</p>
        <h2>2022 revisjon &quot;Tehnika areneb – kas inimene ka?&quot;</h2>
        <p>20. sajand tõi inimkonnale peale hüppelise tehnika arengu ka ootusärevuse. Ärevus täitis päid mõtetega sellest, kuhu see kõik viia võiks ning millistesse kõrgustesse võiks inimkond tõusta. Niisiis, on tehnika areng inimeste võimeid tõstnud või hoopis vastupidi?</p>
        <p>Tehnika arengu üheks suuremaks eesmärgiks on mugavus ja elu hõlbustamine. Kauged eelkäijad avastasid, et kiviga on kookospähkleid mugavam avada kui kätega. Tulemasinaga tuld teha on hõlpsam kui kahe kiviga sädemest tuld luua. Autoga on vahemaid võrreldamatult kiirem läbida kui kondiauru väel või hobuse seljas. Kuid Yuval Noah Harari toob oma teoses &quot;Sapiens. Inimkonna lühiajalugu&quot; välja tendentsi, mis käib tehnika arenguga kaasas: alguses on uued leiutised kõigest luksus, kuid ajapikku saavad need vajadusteks. Kunagi olid külmkapid vaid jõukamatele kättesaadavad, nüüd on need praktiliselt igas kodus ning neist sõltutakse eluvajaliku toidu säilitamisel. Rääkimata kapi ja seal hoitava toidu valmistamiseks vaja minevast elektri- ja kanalisatsioonitaristust. Kuidas aga jätkuks elu, kui voolu kadumisega lõpetaks külmkapp ning selle kõrval ka äratuskell ja arvuti töötamast? Tõenäoliselt ei jätkuks igapäevaelu, vaid esimeseks prioriteediks saaks elektri taastamine, mida ei suuda üksikinimene teha. Tehnika teeb elu mugavaks, kuid seda oskuste ja teadmiste arvelt, pannes inimesi sõltuma nendestsamadest mugavustest. Muidugi avab see võimaluse aina rohkem spetsialiseeruda, kuid siiski tekitab see keerulise prioriteetide seadmise probleemi: mida, millal, <strong>milleks</strong> ja <strong>kuidas</strong> me kasutame?</p>
        <p>Tänapäevaks on kõiksugu leiutised hõlbustanud või asendanud pea kõik, mis nõuab füüsilist pingutust. Tehastes on robotid, kaevamiseks ekskavaatorid, liikumiseks autod ning meelelahutuse saab otse koduselt ekraanilt: otsene vajadus  kodust eemale liikuda on suuresti kadunud. Mõni aasta tagasi võidi &quot;Wall-E&quot; abitult tooli naelutatud kosmoselaeva reisijate üle naerda, kuid nüüdseks on massiline ülekaalulisus muutunud Ameerikas kriitiliseks ning ebatervislikult staatiline eluviis ja peamiselt istumist nõudvad tööd probleemiks üle maailma. Olukord on seda täbaram, et uuringud näitavad füüsise väga tihedat seotust vaimse tervise ja võimekusega.</p>
        <p>Lisaks on see mugavus tulnud ka sotsialiseerumise arvelt. Iseteenindus on asendamas teenindajaid ning taksojuhid oma tööd kaotamas robotautodele. Google reklaamis paar aastat tagasi tehisintellekti, kes suutis käsu peale veenva inimhäälega juuksurile helistades aja broneerida. Pealtnäha teevad need võimalused inimeste elu paremaks, kuid vähendavad märgatavalt inimestevahelist kokkupuudet, kaotades pikapeale nii eneseväljendusoskuse kui ka võime teistest aru saada. Suhtlus digikanalites näib ahvatlev, lastes lähedastega reaalajas sõnumeid vahetada olenemata vahemaadest. Teisest käest võib see küll jätta illusiooni suhtlusest ja sidemest, kuid näib rohkem nagu ajutise sillana tekitades olukorra, kus inimesed on kontaktis kuid eraldatud, koos kuid üksi. Pika peale võivad inimesed muutuda Martin Scorsese filmi &quot;Taksojuht&quot; peategelase sarnaseks: isekaks ja teistest täiesti võõraks. Interneti anonüümsus hõlbustab võimalust näha reaalajas seda võõrandumist, nägudeta kommentaaride dehumaniseerimise efekti ja inimeste radikaliseerimist erinevates foorumites, nagu 4chan. Lisaks on Jaapanis _hikikomori'_de märkimisväärne tõus on tekitanud iibekriisi ning see näitab, et turvaliselt koduselt ekraanilt leitav ei suuda siiski päriselt inimsuhtlust asendada.</p>
        <p>Võiks ju loota, et tehnoloogia areng on andnud inimestele rohkem vaba aega, vaimseid ressursse ning teinud sellega võimalikuks Oscar Wilde'i unistuse individualismi arengust. Nüüd, kus Maslow' püramiidi põhivajadused on justkui täidetud ning ebavajalik füüsiline vaev suuresti automatiseeritud, peaks igaüks saama keskenduda oma soovitud motiveerivatele tegevustele ning ennast teostades ka inimkonda edasi viia. Eneseteostus ja sellest tulenev pikaajaline rahulolu aga nõuavad pühendumust, järjepidevust, vaeva ja teatud määral ka vigasid ja põrumist. Oma annete realiseerimise kantud vilja saab pigem näha hiljem kui varem, mistõttu võib teekond hetkes tunduda valuline. Seda raskemaks muudavad ettevõtmise konstantselt meelitavad dopamiinilaksud meelelahutuse ja lühiajaliste mõnude kujul. Just nagu Aldous Huxley &quot;Heas uues ilmas&quot; kirjeldati somatablette, võetakse ebamugavust kohates pihku pinisevaid ja värvilisi tähelepanu nõudvaid teavitusi täis telefon, vaadatakse algoritmi poolt just õigele isikule suunatud TikToki lühiklippi või lülitatakse käima järgmine pinev liigvaatamiseks konstrueeritud Netflixi sari. See surmab süvenemisvõime, lühiajaliste ebamugavuste talumisoskuse ja ahendab nii mõttevõimet kui eneseväljendusoskusi orwelliliku uuskeele tasemeni. Näib, et mõne aja pärast peame leidma viisi masinatega peale andmesäilituse ja -töötluse ka teised vaimsed ülesanded inimeste asemel ära tegema.</p>
        <p>Seega tundub, et tehnoloogia arengu tulemuse kasutuseesmärk on nihkunud muutunud inimeste abistamisest inimeste asendamisele. Tehnoloogia areneb aina kiiremini, kuid näib, et inimeste areng on pigem stagneerunud või isegi sattunud taandarengusse. Asi pole tehnoloogias endas, vaid selle küsitlemata kasutamises. Produktiivsus on vaieldamatult kasvanud, kuid kas saame end usaldada selle õigesti kasutamisega või peaks Frank Herberti &quot;Düüni&quot; kombel pöörama rõhu inimeste enda vaimsele ja füüsilisele arengule?</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Globaalse virtuaalmaastiku roll töösuhetes]]></title>
      <link>https://jamfox.dev/blog/virtuaalmaastiku-roll-toomaastikul/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p><em>Essee TalTech HOX6061_KJ &quot;Õiguse alused&quot; aine jaoks.</em></p>
        <p>Töösuhted ning võimalused tasu eest tööd teha on digiajastul palju muutunud. Kui varem eelistati traditsioonilist töölepingut, siis enam ei pruugi see ahvatlev olla, eriti näiteks kui töö sisu ei nõua tegelikult kindlas asukohas ja vahemikus töötamist, aga leping nõuab. Rutiinse iseloomuga töökohad on aina vähemahvatlevad ning alternatiivideks on tekkinud näiteks teenuste või asjade müümine interneti kaudu, virtuaalkauplemine ja platvormitöö.</p>
        <p>Tööleping annab riikliku õigusega tagatud turvalisuse mõlemale osapoolele, et tööandja saab tellitud töö ning töötaja saab töö eest palga. Kuid tööleping on kulukas: tööandja peab kinni pidama sotsiaalmaksu [1], töötuskindlustusmakse [2] ning töötaja kogumispensionimakse [3], töötuskindlustusmakse [2] ning tulumaksu [4]. Näiteks 871.20 eurot netotasuna teeniva töötaja kulud tööandjale on 1338 eurot, ehk töötajani jõuab 65.11% tööandja kogukulust. Tööandjale kasulikumad alternatiivid on töövõtu- ning käsundusleping, mille puhul pole suhe nii rangelt reguleeritud kui töölepinguga ning lepingu lõpetamine on lihtsam [5]. Käsundus- ja töövõtulepingud ei kohusta töötajat töötama kindlatel aegadel, määratud asukohas [5], kuid samuti jäävad välja ka soodustused ning õigused, mis tuleks kaasa töölepinguga, kusjuures maksustamine jääb samaks [6]. Võib öelda, et töövõtu- ning käsundusleping täidavad halli ala töölepingu ning ümbrikupalga vahel. Lepinguta ümbrikupalga puhul oleksid tööandja kogukulu ning töötaja netotasu võrdsed, kuid nii puudub kindlus, et palk üldse töötajani jõuab, nagu see on probleemiks olnud eriti tihti ning pikaajaliselt ehitussektoris [7].</p>
        <p>Erakordse kiirusega on Euroopas ja Eestis populaarsust kogunud platvormitöö sellistel platvormidel nagu Uber, Taxify, Bolt, GoWorkaBit ja UpWork [8]. Platvormitööd tehes säilib uuel moel alluva-tööandja suhe, kus platvormil pakutakse määratud ülesanded kindla tasuga, kuid suures pildis vastutavad töötajad ise selle eest, kui palju tööd nad teha soovivad. Platvormitöö suurim eelis on stabiilsuse ja paidlikkuse tasakaal. Kuid alluva-tööandja suhe ei ole aga ainuke variant. Digiajastu ja globaalne internet on andnud paljudele olla iseseisev vabakutseline teenusepakkuja sellistel platvormidel nagu Youtube, Twitch, Patreon ja Etsy. Sellistel platvormidel pole kindlust ülesannete ning tasu osas: teenusepakkuja määrab ise, mida ta pakkuda soovib ning tasu oleneb täielikult huvitatud klientidest. Vabakutseline töötaja peab ise vastutama enda töötingimuste, ravikindlustuse ning olenevalt ka pensioni- ja töötuskindlustuse tagamise eest [9]. Sealjuures on platvormitöö ainuke tekkinud uutest virtuaaltöödest, milles on näha märkimisväärset õigusliku raamistiku arengut [8]. Platvormitöö muutub aina kättesaadavamaks õiguslikumalt sõbralikumaks töötajatele ning seetõttu ka ahvatlevamaks isikutele, kes soovivad paindlikumat tööd.</p>
        <p>Lisaks on tekkinud tehnoloogia arenguga mitmed vabakutselised ning täiesti iseseisvalt mittetraditsioonilised töötajad, kes peavad aga oma kindluse tagama ise, sest neid on raske - kui mitte võimatu - kuhugi praegustes õiguslikes raamistikes paigutuda. Virtuaaltööde maastik on õiguslikult keerulises olukorras, sest virutaaltöö väänab ja painutab traditsioonilist töö tähendust ja olemust. Näiteks on tekkinud ka teenimisvõimalusi, milles puudub ka teenusepakkuja ja kliendi vaheline suhe. Sinna alla kuuluvad näiteks mängudes virtuaalkauplemine, krüptovaluutade ja aktsiate kauplemine [8]. Tegemist on hallide aladega, mille jaoks on väga raske õiguslikke raamistikke luua. Selgeim näide töö ebamäärasest tähendusest on mäng Roblox, mille sihtgrupiks on lapsed ja noored. Robloxi tulude määr oleneb sellest, kui palju mängu mängijad ise mängule sisu juurde loovad. Nii on tekkinud suur hulk noori ja lapsi, kes loovad mängule sisu ning teenivad sellega kaudselt mängufirmale raha, kuid õiguslikult nad tööd ei tee [10]. Võiks ju öelda, et nad teevad siiski tööd, kuid antud näitel paljud neist jäävad tehtud töö eest täielikult kompenseerimata.</p>
        <p>Üldpildis liiguvad töösuhted aina rohkem töötaja iseseisvuse poole, andes töötajale rohkem vabadust, kuid sellega kaasnevalt ka rohkem riske ja kohustusi. Viimastel aastatel on olnud suur areng platvormitöö reguleerimises, kuid on tekkinud ka mitmeid töövorme, mida on väga raske õiguslikult määratleda ja reguleerida, näiteks virtuaalkauplemine ning mängudesse sisu loomine.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Lõppsõna 2019 lõpuklassi jaoks Spikris]]></title>
      <link>https://jamfox.dev/blog/loppsona-2019/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Kallid Spikri lugejad! Austatud koolivennad ja -õed! Lugupeetud Saue Gümnaasiumi õpilased ja õpetajad!</p>
        <p>Peale tosinat aastat on lõpuks saanud küpseks Saue Gümnaasiumi kõige uhkem, kõige esinduslikum ja vaieldamatult kõige targem lend. Aeg on tulnud saata laia maailma oma tiibu sirutama see abiturientide etalon. Miski ei saa peatada neid imetegusid, mida hakkab korda saatma Saue Gümnaasiumi viimane 12. klassi lõpetanud lend. Lennu number polegi tähtis, meid ei saa ju meenutada nii triviaalse asja järgi, oleme selleks liiga erilised. Meie, kui Saue ‘Matemaatika’ Gümnaasiumi lõpetajad, teame paremini kui keegi teine, kui tähtsad ja suursugused on numbrid, kuid me oleme neist üle. Soovime et meid mäletataks kui Viimane Lend. Nüüd te kindlasti proovite oma peas välja nuputada kuidas sai “sellisest” koolist tulla nii perfektsiooni lähedane lend. Lubagem asuda seda nüüd teile seletama, kuna vastus on tegelikult üpriski lihtsakoeline oma olemuses.</p>
        <p>Kogu jant algas aastal 2007 (kahjuks polnud majanduskriis veel päris hoogu sisse saanud, oleks veelgi rohkem karastanud). Nii nagu iga klass peab alustama oma teekonda esimesest klassist ja siis välja jõudma selle allegoorilise vaimse Everesti tippu, milleks on 12. klass, pidime seda ka meie tegema. Kuid vaat kuis Everest sai meile hoopis ülima eesmärgi asemel hüppelauaks. Läbi tule vere ja pisarate jõudsime hoopis Kuule. Ilmatu suur samm meie jaoks, veelgi suurem samm meie kalli kooli maine jaoks.</p>
        <p>Võtame nüüd vaatluse alla hoopis gümnaasiumi. Imelise Saue Gümnaasiumi, mis pakkus meile mitmeid teid. Meile anti tohutult lai valik erinevaid teid ja suundi. Kohati võttis lausa silme eest kirjuks. Lõpuks - vägagi üllataval kombel - valisime kõik kooli tungival soovitusel reaalsuuna. Eks need reaalained olegi ju loogilisemad ja elulisemad - varsti võetakse niikuinii kõik tööd peale programmeerimise ära ja siis on matat vaja! “Vähem mögöš rohkem tögöš” sai meie mantraks nende sadade tundide matemaatika kodutööde, harjutuste ja tööde kestel. Kuigi ega humanitaaristki puudu tulnud. Oo ei, mu austatud auditoorium. Kirjanduses lugesime “1984” kokkuvõtet ja isegi “Tõe ja õiguse” film tuli täpselt enne eksamit, seega eesti keele eksam läheb meil raudselt ilma igasuguse vaevata. Noh ja siis need teised: ajalugu, ühiskond, keeled ja mis kõik muu - needki olid ilmatult lihtsad. Viimastesse väga ei vaevunud minemagi, aga kui läksime siis needki kulusid matemaatika kodutöö peale. Aga ega nende kohta eksamit tehtagi ju.</p>
        <p>Saue Gümnaasiumi parim lend jätab teid meie tolmu imetlema ja soovib teile edu ja jaksu edaspidi! Küll te toime tulete ilma meieta, loodetavasti! Jumalaga sõbrad! Jääte meid igatsema, aga küll me teid tõenäoliselt uuesti külastame. Edu! Head aega! Dasvidanje! Arrivederci! Au Revoir! Shalom! Valete! (Vaat kuis keeletunnid on vilja kandnud!)</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Time and time again I have ran into the problem of not having anyone to discuss the things I enjoy with. Love running and lifting? &quot;Though shit, exercise ain't hip, unless you do it for the girls.&quot; Feel like doing math problems on a Friday night? &quot;What the fuck is wrong with you?&quot; Enjoy analysing films? &quot;Why can't you just enjoy it, turn your brain off.&quot; Well, this was no different with anime - started watching and realised it was another interest that no-one IRL was really into. Like for many, the first stop for anyone wanting to get in on dicussions related to their hobbies was Reddit. No different for me, shuffled to r/anime and found enough reading to do, but couldn't really get into the conversations sadly (that's what I get for not browsing New feed). So my second idea was to find a discord server. Searching r/anime proved to of help:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>Milk's old post.</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Usually advertising discords is double-bad-<strong><em>ILLEGAL</em></strong> on r/anime, but thanks to some miracle this post managed to slip through! And man am I glad, otherwise I would've missed out on one of the most meaningful experiences that the power of the web has ever provided for me.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Legendary Kaito appears!</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The beginning to my Discord adventures was quite slow because I liked to frequent the place when I had nothing better to do in class - which meant during the day, when most of the members were sleeping or what have you. However the two that saved me from boredom were Psych and Kaito. Especially Kaito, with whom I did my first tandem-anime-watch thingy. We had a whole new channel made for us, we watched Kino's journey, an episode a day, and discussed to our hearts content. Sadly the channel was removed so I have no way to revisit our wonderful convos, but I was one of the greatest times - I finally had someone to share my thoughts with. Later some other people showed interest in group watches too, we had quite a few actually, but the one that stood out was Mawaru Penguindrum, surprisingly. The channel for that was also removed, but it was great while it lasted. Huge shoutout to Cade, he was really active on that one.</p>
        <h2>The relationship chart</h2>
        <p>So after we'd chatted a while Milk mentioned something that caught my attention:</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-04-18_10-31-35.png" alt="" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>&quot;thats some effort&quot;</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Since I'd had so much fun with the people there I got stuck on the idea that I should update the chart and make a more <em>refined</em> one. Got Kaito to help with the lore since he was already a veteran of the server. He wrote a doc full of inside jokes and happenings + some descriptions of the people and I went to town on Photoshop. My skill with PS were rusty, but I don't regret the hours spent on the chart in the slightest.</p>

        <h2>Roleplay and The Kingdom Map</h2>
        <p>Since the relationship chart was a hit and people had been talking about doing some roleplay, new ideas raced to my head. On a whim Milk changed the servers name from &quot;Milk's cafe&quot; to &quot;Milk's Kingdom&quot; and everyone followed suit and changed their names accordingly to medieval times. Logically, the only conclusion was that we needed a map for the kingdom, so I proposed the idea, people agreed and thus this was born after many revisions and banters later:</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/town44.png" alt="" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>26/03/2018</strong></em></p>

        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-04-18_10-54-03.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The ideas sprawled and evolved into evermore ridiculous ones and the roleplaying channel became the most active one. Quite a lot of people contributed to the event and in the end we, mainly with Kaito, wrote notes for the locations on the map. They're chock-full of inside jokes and hidden nods to the convos at the time:</p>
        <p><strong>The trail of No Return</strong> – It has been told that once one enters Milk’s Kingdom of Weebs they will never be able to leave. People can visit other places, but will turn insane if they’re gone for too long. Many have not withstood the madness and have found their end in the Suicide creek.</p>
        <p><strong>Suicide Creek</strong> – Leaving the Kingdom has turned many to the side of madness and has made them decide to say goodbye to this cruel world at the bottom of this creek. The remains of the late space, Todd and Idlewaifu are still providing the local trouts necessary snacking.</p>
        <p><strong>The Lonely Lab of Kaito</strong> – Not finding the promised Divine _<strong>T</strong>_aste from the town, Maester Kaito decided to return to his studies as a high scholar. He moved into a laboratory that King Milk ordered the plebian weebs to build for him.</p>
        <p><strong>An unsuspicious house</strong> – A completely ordinary house, unusually far from the town. Many have spotted Ser Jam walking around this general location at night. Surely he’s not doing anything suspicious.</p>
        <p><strong>JamDaniel’s Brewery</strong> – Ser Jam’s founded brewery, for he did not find alcohol for his tastes when he arrived. In fact upon his arrival there wasn’t a single store that sold alcohol, and for he did not wish to drink the town drunkard’s fishy homemade moonshine he decided to brew his own Whiskey.</p>
        <p><strong>The Great Three, aka The Theatres of Animangus</strong> – The three most popular buildings of the town, the raison d’être of the town: Melchiorus, Balthasarus and Casperus provide the townspeople the entertainment for three different tastes - The Elitist, The Plebist and The Otomist respectively.</p>
        <p><strong>Lady Kikile’s Church</strong> – Oppressed by the Kingdom’s main religion - The Waifulewdists - the church is only frequented by three people. It has been said that it can stay afloat thanks to Ser Unit’s occasional support and their hidden underground otomeist community. It’s masterfully hidden and only one outsider has wandered in there - Ser Jam on one whiskey-filled night. The Cult of Fujoshi, called the filthy fujoshi by everyone living in the Kingdom, believe that 3D men are to be burned at the stake, and are obsessed with their 2D husbandoes.</p>
        <p><strong>St. Sasa’s Cathedral</strong> – Upon arrival Sasa spread his knowledge of his religion - lewdism. He renovated the old church, left behind by the previous king, into a glorious cathedral and became the Saint. Milk agreed to this on one condition: that the religion be merged with waifuism. Thus was born the waifulewdism.</p>
        <p><strong>The picture archive of the unattired</strong> - While the cathedral was big, it wasn’t big enough to house the lewds of Sasa. The import of the unattired waifu pictures overflowed the cathedral and a three-story building was built. After multiple extensions it is now bigger than the cathedral itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Meadow of Koenie</strong> – A meadow that now belongs to the half-cow, half-human knight Koenie. It is still popular among the townspeople for its relaxing atmosphere, and Koenie welcomes them quite happily.</p>
        <p><strong>The River of Shit Taste</strong> – Like many other great towns, Milk’s Kingdom was also built next to a river, once called the river of Good Taste. Unfortunately, after erecting the city walls just a tad farther from it, the areas next to the river became slums, the Jojogus and Otomegus, and the river suddenly changed color. Drinking water from the river recently renamed the River of Shit Taste causes mass loss of brain cells and yields a high risk of infection by shounen. The kingdom now has to import water at fairly high prices.</p>
        <p><strong>A.A. art museum</strong> - The Art Appreciation museum, where art from all over come for the viewing pleasure of all.</p>
        <p><strong>Kiki’s gallery</strong> - Lady Kikile’s own gallery where she puts her works in display.</p>
        <p><strong>Grasslands of the Armored Cows</strong> - There’s a peculiar rumor spread around by the town’s drunkard, that at very specific days the <em>loricatorum boves pulchrae</em> (latin for armored cows) come out to attack unsuspecting visitors.</p>
        <p><strong>Library</strong> - Library for normie books. (I was the only one using this ;_;)</p>
        <p><strong>Toshokan</strong>(weeb for library) - Library for manga</p>
        <p><strong>The dock</strong> - Owned by the Industrechant Guild. This is where the “Con” boats come and supply the town with “merch”.</p>
        <p><strong>Tea Lounge</strong> - After Maester Kaito’s invention of the **<em>T</em>**ea that heals almost everything, there was no longer need for a hospital. The whole staff was fired and a Tea Lounge was created. The leftover equipment was left there for self-service procedures.</p>
        <p><strong>Swolemeister’s</strong> - A fully equipped gym built thanks to Ser Jam’s manipulations in other towns. He managed to convince the leading Swolemeister family to build a state of the art gym, for he couldn’t leave the Kingdom, but still needed a way to bulk. Only Korma and Jam are regulars there. Maester Kaito has promised several times that he will start frequenting it, but has not gone there even once.</p>
        <p><strong>Koenie’s</strong> - Koenie’s restaurant built after he graduated <em>Tōtsuki</em> Saryō Ryōri Gakuen.</p>
        <p><strong>Milk’s Royal Residence: The Castle</strong> - His Majesty’s residence is just as you would expect it to be, a medieval-style, enormous white castle. While it is unknown if all the rooms in the castle are used or not, it is known that His Majesty’s favorite is what he likes to call the GWENT room. Ser Unit also lives in the castle.</p>
        <p><strong>Warcsi’s residence</strong> - Warcsi established his residence right next to the Merchant’s Trail so he would have an easy time welcoming the traders and merchants alike. It wasn’t completely out of his happiness for the visitors, nor was it to ward of his desolation and loneliness. Actually it was so he could buy yeast and corn to feed his addiction of homemade moonshine.</p>
        <p><strong>Wester’s residence</strong> - Living far away from the town is not inconvenient for Wester at all. Possessing vast knowledge about everything in this world, arguably even more than The **<em>S</em>**cholar, he uses his house to practice the magic he calls “science”. He has said that he likes to build “spaceships”, but what these “spaceships” are is  unknown. Kaito has been seen around this house several times.</p>
        <p><strong>Industrechant Guild</strong> - Once there were 2 guilds called the Industrial Guild and Merchant Guild, but these guilds were so close to each other and working together very tightly anyway so they agreed to merge, thus becoming the Industrechant Guild.</p>
        <h3>Lore for the map</h3>
        <p>The roleplay thing got so much attention that Gem, Milk and Unit (if I remember correctly) decided to write a freaking novel for the Milk Kingdom's lore. Here it is, though it was never finished:</p>
        <p>In a small land on the Anime planet, there lived a young boy named Milk. He saw how the townspeople of <em>Nerds and Geeks</em>(town name) were in despair due to a government that treated them unjustly. He decided to stand up against the unruly by working his way up, socially, alongside Villager#1 and the former Hand of the King, who helped him gain his current role. Unfortunately, due to an unforeseen accident, Villager#1 became mute, and the first Hand of the King passed away. To help him move the kingdom forward, King Milk recruited Ser Unit as his right hand man.</p>
        <p>Both of them laid out the groundwork and decided to recruit people to advance the Kingdom. Town Priestess, Apprentice Kaito, Duchesse Kikile of Baguetteland, Psych, Sasafred, and Lenny formed a group to research on development. Due to their accomplishments, Psych, Sasafred, and Lenny earned the titles Ser, Señor, and Town Crier respectively. Additionally, Sasafred was later gifted a brothel.. to satisfy his and his Grace’s… <em>needs</em>.</p>
        <p>After the Kingdom had been steadily growing for some time, King Milk declared the Kingdom be named “Kingdom of Weebs,” which attracted weebs from all over the world. Numerous villagers either planted their roots in his Kingdom or were simply curious travellers passing by..</p>
        <p>Maester Kaito decided to return to his studies as a high scholar. His cravings for knowledge needed to be satisfied and staying in the castle would not help him accomplish his goal. He moved into a laboratory that King Milk ordered the plebian weebs to build as a safe haven for him.</p>
        <p>Duchesse Kikile of Baguetteland moved permanently into the Kingdom of Weebs. She truly wanted to help the growing community in her own way and spread the word. Despite being beautiful and having received countless marriage proposals from suitors, she turned them all down, even from the King. King Milk still holds her in high regard and gifted her a manor.</p>
        <p>Ser Psych proved his worth and continued to guard the King in the castle. He had insecurities due to his short height, but after obtaining the title of an outstanding Knight, everyone looks up to him and is loved by the people.</p>
        <p>Koenie moved from the far pastures to apply as a Knight in the Weeb Kingdom. He excelled in not only his Knighthood as Ser Koenie, but also as a chef. He is half cow-half human, but no one seemed to care.</p>
        <p>JamFox mysteriously creeped into the Kingdom one night. No one knows where he came from, where he’s going, or what his intentions are. To people’s surprise, he quickly jumped into a trusted Knight role by the King. After obtaining the role, power went to his head. He does not know when to stop and pursued even more power by starting a coup against King Milk by recruiting Sorceress GemGem, Zookeper Cade, and Princess Zelda. King Milk knew Ser JamFox’s intentions but still warmly welcomed every new person he brought into the Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Sorceress GemGem was hooked in unknowingly. She quickly turned against Ser JamFox by dedicating her knowledge to help King Milk rule the Kingdom and in turn became Court Wizard and was bestowed with the title of Lady.</p>
        <p>Zookeeper Cade had a different outlook. He fully wanted to assist Ser JamFox in his revolution and dethrone King Milk. He would occasionally use his Skinwalker ability to transform into one of the pets he has and spy for information from the castle.</p>
        <p>Princess Zelda, recently entered the Kingdom with the goal of helping the children as a teacher. She knew how to fight and defend herself which motivates her in passing on her abilities to younger generations in hopes of helping the Kingdom’s defence to be stronger.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, there’s always a drunk in town. No one knows what he’s saying. They would let him walk around and try not to involve themselves with him as much as possible.</p>

        <p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
        <p>Chapters order from newest member to the oldest as the story gets deeper.</p>
        <p><strong>CHAPTER 1 - PRINCESS ZELDA</strong></p>
        <p>“I’ll help you get out of this slum of a city. Just follow me and travel east where weebs all over the world gather. We’ll continue our talk there,” a mysterious passerby spoke in her ear while she was walking home from her daily patrol. She quickly turned her head in response but the stranger was already out of sight.</p>
        <p>Princess Zelda, a pale short-haired brunette wandered along the narrow roads of Hyrule, if it could even be called one. Hyrule collapsed years ago before she was born, but the royal blood in her veins still proved to be true. Everyone knew of her existence and in turn tried to ignore her, some even went to such lengths as sending an assassin to make sure a royal will never take the throne again.</p>
        <p>Zelda was called a countless number of degrading names by the past nation’s citizens, but she never wavered. Princess Zelda learned the art of self defense and withstood all of the trials on her path. She believed that someday she would be able to revive Hyrule to its previous glory - no, greater than its previous glory. Nevertheless, she was never alone. Countless of sympathizers gathered for her cause having witnessed her working relentlessly from afar. Elders became her advisors and children became her students.</p>
        <p>Normally, she wouldn’t think twice when a random person tried to get her into something since normally they would be up to no good, but something about the mysterious boy piqued her interest with how he mentioned the ‘land in the east where weebs gather.’ It was rumored around the world how a young boy was able to overthrow the rotten government and set up a new Kingdom staffed by his loyal followers. Also rumoured was how the new Kingdom became peaceful, attracted tourists and merchants, and how the residents were happier than anywhere else. Zelda deeply wanted to see the place for herself with her own two eyes. How could a young boy achieve something that grand a scale? How did he amass such a following? She wanted to learn all there was to know about the mysterious boy.</p>
        <p>“Elders,” the Princess shouted on the top of her lungs in the usual gathering place, a small cabin made of logs and hay cleverly hidden deep in an alley. They had no choice. This was the perfect place out of the public eye where everyone could safely gather. “I wish to take on a journey to the rumoured legendary land in the east where weebs gather. We all have heard rumors about the place and how respected the current King is. I sincerely hope you all understand my decision in going away from my homeland to learn everything I can in order to assist Hyrule.”</p>
        <p>Zelda’s voice was strong and firm leaving no space for argument. All of the Elders knew they could not keep her caged within the fallen city forever once they saw how bright her eyes shone. “We understand. Princess, please take good care of yourself.” They could only pray that the glimmer in her eyes would not be deluded during her journey.</p>
        <p>****************************</p>
        <p>Walking through the wilderness was no easy venture. It took her a whole month with stops at multiple cities for rest and supplies. She continued following the Merchant’s Trail, as people in previous cities suggested that was the right thing to do. It was not difficult for her to hitch a ride with some wandering merchant or the like, once they saw how formidable a bodyguard Zelda was capable of being due to her training in self-defence. Finally, after a seeming eternity, from Zelda’s point of view, the Kingdom of Weebs was on the horizon.</p>
        <p>“I see you have arrived, O’ Princess Zelda of the Fallen Land,” a light brown haired boy with a cunning face came out to greet her as she walked past the entrance gates.</p>
        <p>“That voice. You’re him”</p>
        <p>“What if I am?”</p>
        <p>“Who the hell are you and why did you summon me here?”</p>
        <p>“Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm,” he tapped his finger on his chin in a teasing gesture. “Don’t worry about me. I summoned you here because you are a possible sympathizer to my cause, and I also think you could prove very useful in ensuring the future plans I have in store go accordingly.”</p>
        <p>“What plans?”</p>
        <p>“Bye! Have fun while you’re here!” the light brown haired boy sped off, bleeding into the ocean of merchants and villagers entering the Kingdom.</p>
        <p>“Weird dude,” she murmured as she took a mental note of being cautious of involving herself in his matters. She was only there for her own research after all, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
        <p>As she carried her belongings and strolled deeper into the General Town Center,</p>
        <p>“<strong>YOUR HUSBANDO IS SHIT!</strong>”</p>
        <p>“<strong>YOUR LEWDS ARE SHIT!</strong>”</p>
        <p>“<strong>I DON’T IMPOSE MY LEWDS ON YOU!</strong>”</p>
        <p>“Lady Kikile, Ser Psych, please calm down. Both of you are attracting unwanted attention.”</p>
        <p>Two people were shouting at each other in the middle of the Center. They… seemed close. An angry girl who looked like a high ranking person stomped her feet several times to make her point. Her opponent was dressed like a Knight, and there was a woman holding a staff trying to mediate between the two. It was amazing to Zelda how accepting this Kingdom must be to allow people to argue about their tastes in the open.</p>
        <p>“BUT MY HUSBANDO AREN’T NAKED, DUH,” the girl assumed to be Lady Kikile flipped her hair and walked away from the argument site…. without looking ahead. “Eh,” her body bumped into Zelda’s. “Sorry! I wasn’t looking ahead because that dumb piece of shit over there is making me aggravated. Are you alright? You’re not hurt?,” there were no injuries, but Lady Kiki did walk into Zelda at full speed, so a meaningful force was involved.</p>
        <p>“I’m fine,” Zelda replied as she heard a raunch “HEY!” from the guy Lady Kikile was arguing with.</p>
        <p>“I do apologize for our behavior. If you don’t mind, I’d like to treat you to something. You’re new in town, right? I’ve never seen you before. It’ll be great to have another girl friend!” she chirped. Without waiting for her answer, Zelda was dragged along with the three strange people, having no clue what new experiences awaited.</p>
        <p>They arrived at some manor, presumably Kikile’s. At the entrance, there stood a grouping of beautiful, thorned rose bushes welcoming them. <em>This could either go awesome, and I’ll learn plenty, or I’ll be toyed with and murdered</em>, Zelda couldn’t keep herself from these thoughts. <em>These people are too friendly. Or perhaps it is a custom of this Kingdom to welcome strangers this way?</em>, Zelda was pensative. Regardless, she took the risk and headed in. The four were quickly seated in a sunroom that provided a beautiful view of the rose garden.</p>
        <p>“Plebs, prepare afternoon tea with baguettes for my three guests and I,” Lady Kikile told a servant, who swiftly went to fulfill her oder. “Ah! Where are my manners. My name is Kikile. I’m the Duchess of Baguetteland, a land in a kingdom far, far from here. These two here are my friends,” she motioned to the the guy who she had an argument with earlier and the woman with the staff.</p>
        <p>“Hey. I’m Psych, a Knight.”</p>
        <p>“And I’m GemGem, a Sorceress. It’s nice to meet you.”</p>
        <p>“Psych’s a retard, don’t listen to him,” the poor guy was shaking his head in response, “GemGem’s nice. You can talk to her. And GemGem….” Lady Kikile turned her attention to the Sorceress, “Stop calling me ‘Lady’ already.”</p>
        <p>“Agreed, and drop the Ser while you’re at it” Ser Psych joined in.</p>
        <p>“But! I can’t just disrespect you two!” GemGem argued.</p>
        <p>“Remember, you’re a ‘Lady’ yourself, and furthermore, we’re all friends here. No need to be formal, especially in my home,” Lady Kikile reminded the Sorceress.</p>
        <p>GemGem looked like she was in a pinch, so Zelda interrupted with an introduction, “Nice to meet you all! I’m Zelda from Hyrule,” she left out the ‘Princess’ title. It was no longer relevant anyway.</p>
        <p>“Hyrule?” Lady GemGem questioned, “I’d read in a scroll that it had fallen years ago. Never would I have thought the kingdom was still inhabited.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, there are small communities trying to help bring Hyrule back to shape,” Zelda looked into their eyes with obvious determination, “Thank you for bringing up the topic. I’ve travelled here to the Kingdom of Weebs because there were rumors of how great the current King is and how he saved the previous citizens from certain doom. I’d like to know more about that.”</p>
        <p><strong>CHAPTER 2 - ZOOKEEPER CADE</strong></p>
        <p>“Boy, quite a collection you have here,” a quirky, cheerful, light brown haired boy who was not but a stranger to him an hour ago was trotting about in the Zookeeper’s private room, bearing a curious gaze.</p>
        <p>Cade was a brown-haired and fairly built young boy who, because of an unceasing love of all animals, caused people to keep their distance from him. He would scoff at people who thought that cute dogs and cats, or anything of the like, were the only acceptable pets. They would point their fingers at him in disgust, but it went both ways since he thought they were the ones who were being hypocrites.</p>
        <p>“Now tell me your name,” Cade demanded of the stranger boy. Not a single soul had ever stepped into his precious room, but this person gave out a peculiar aura compared to anyone else he had met. This could perhaps be the only opportunity to make a human connection, he thought.</p>
        <p>“Hmmmm,” the boy hummed teasingly. “You do not need to know who I am yet. For you will one day be working with me for a cause grander than you or I,” the mysterious person strolled around waving at Cade’s reptiles playfully. Even Catherine, Cade’s most loyal reptile, seemed to like the boy.</p>
        <p>“Fine. What do you want?” Cade asked. It was probably safe to lower his guard around a person his pets took a liking to, despite not knowing a single thing about the boy.</p>
        <p>“I need you to meet me at the border of the legendary Kingdom of Weebs,” he was half-singing his sentence as if mimicking a children’s song. “You know where that is, right?”</p>
        <p>“Who wouldn’t? Anyone with common sense knows of that place.”</p>
        <p>“Good,” the light brown haired boy gave him a satisfied smile. “See you there, then!” he dashed out of the room, the house, and soon out of sight, waving his right arm goodbye at Cade. <em>Funny guy</em>, Cade thought.</p>
        <p>The doors closed to silence. Once again, Cade was alone with his animals. “Freak Zoo” was what the people called his place. He lived out in the country where communities could easily be avoided, but, regrettably, he forgot to consider how close-minded people in small villages were.</p>
        <p>The Kingdom of Weebs wasn’t exactly far away from his house. It would take around a week by carriage, but the idea still bothered him a little due to his dear animals. He couldn’t possibly leave them alone in this horrifying village, the people would surely set his house on fire with the intention of killing all of them in his absence. <em>Or I could…</em> Cade stared at his hands, <em>No… The only way possible is to take all them along with me.</em></p>
        <p>Cade started to pack all of his necessary belongings into bags, supplies in boxes, and pets on the back of an old wagon he owned. He felt bad for forcing his reptiles into a much smaller space than they are usually in, but an exception had to be made. After making one last round around his property, he prepared his horse and jumped onto the wagon.</p>
        <p>The horse started pulling the wagon along past the village’s bulletin board. Cade took one last peek on his one-and-only announcement: “Friends Wanted. Must Love Reptiles and Anime!” The flyer with all of his contact information was there since the time he moved into the village, but no one ever took interest, or rather hated the young boy for it, which was why the funny stranger who knocked on his door a couple of hours ago represented a glimmer of hope to Cade.</p>
        <p>****************************</p>
        <p>Gasps followed by shrill exclamations could be heard left and right as Cade advanced down the Trail of No Return:</p>
        <p><em>“<strong>Is he for real!?</strong>”</em></p>
        <p><em>“<strong>How stupid could a man be?</strong>”</em></p>
        <p><em>“<strong>He’s doomed!</strong>”</em></p>
        <p>was some of the gossip directed at him, this made him chuckle. Cade knew all about the horrifying ends people who entered the Kingdom from this path had met, but it would take a fool to actually believe that a trail is cursed. Besides, it would take him another week if he were to use the longer but safer Merchant’s Trail.</p>
        <p>A small sigh escaped Cade’s mouth as he commanded his horse through the borders. The mysterious light brown haired boy never mentioned a date nor time of meetup, so he thought he might as well have a short rest in the city.</p>
        <p>The smell of grilled meat was flowing in the air. Cade sniffed and sniffed, trying to find his way to the source creating the delicious aroma. Fortunately, he didn’t even have to make a trip, a restaurant painted in green with ‘<strong>KOENIE’S</strong>’ in big, white letters was stationed right next to him. Cade parked his wagon on the side of the street and walked right in.</p>
        <p>Pictures of plump, well-fed cows decorated the inside walls. Certifications and recognition papers were hanging on a few corners along with pictures of customers smiling while eating a plate of steak. It seemed like the owner of the humble restaurant truly loved his craft and cared for the customers.</p>
        <p>“Welcome!” an odd-looking person, if he could be called one, came out to greet him. He had a human face with brown-and-white colored cow ears poking off the sides of his head. Normal arms and upper body, but the rest of his lower half was that of a cow’s with a tail to match. “A table for one?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Cade nodded and was taken to his seat. Not many people were in the restaurant, most likely because it was just past two in the afternoon. He saw a pair of women in a corner chatting about an anime he had never heard of and a lone man in the far side of the restaurant shouting “ORAORAORAORA” with beer in hand. <em>What a diverse place</em>, he thought.</p>
        <p>The half-cow-half-human being handed him the menu, and to his surprise, there were only beef-based dishes ranged from meatballs to grilled A5 quality beef. Cade took another peek at the being, back at the menu, and then back at the being… “Cannibalism?” he uttered.</p>
        <p>“HAHAHAHA,” the being let out a hearty laugh, fitting for such a beastly man. “You must be new to this Kingdom. I’m Koenie, a knight, and this is my restaurant, which I work at during my free time. Welcome to the Kingdom of Weebs and welcome to my humble establishment. I hope you enjoy it here.”</p>
        <p>“Thank you,” Cade felt a slight bit of shame crawling up his face. “I’m Cade. Your restaurant looks like a pleasant place to dine in, Ser Koenie” he made sure to use the correct title.</p>
        <p>“I’m honored,” Ser Koenie replied with a smile. “Now, may I have your order?”</p>
        <p>“Beef stew, please”</p>
        <p>“Your dish will be brought to you shortly,” the owner bowed slightly and went off to the kitchen.</p>
        <p>As promised, his beef stew was neatly placed in front of him. The aroma of mixed herbs and spices such as parsley, thyme, and pepper with a hint of cinnamon was exuding from the dish. The young boy was taken aback after having a taste of the tender chunk of meat. Needless to say, it proved impossible for him not to end up licking the bowl clean.</p>
        <p>“I see you’re already fitting in with the crowd,” a familiar voice came from behind. The light-brown haired boy who he travelled here per request was smiling cockily at him. The boy lowered his voice so only both of them could hear his next spine-chilling words, “Now come with me, Cade, The Skinwalker.”</p>
        <p><strong>CHAPTER 3 - SORCERESS GEMGEM</strong></p>
        <p>“Welcome to the Kingdom of Weebs. I will be requiring your services from this point forth,” a cunning light-brown haired boy greeted the young woman at the south entrance of the Kingdom, which was surrounded by industrial sites.</p>
        <p>GemGem, a sorceress who moved away from her homeland seeking knowledge in order to accept all kinds of jobs to sustain her family back in the far west. After her parents divorced and her father moved away, she was burdened with the role of breadwinner for the rest of the family. Possible suitors would approach her in the previous cities she had been in, but the logical side of her mind always rejected their advances.</p>
        <p>This was nothing but another job that the Sorceress was assigned to. She was determined to finish it and move on, but something about the boy seemed suspicious. He chose to stay anonymous and would not inform her of any details regarding the work beforehand. Under normal circumstances she would have rejected the offer, but the job offers were scarce and she had to take anything she could get her hands on. GemGem had memorized all of the self defence spells in case things went south, and a small green jewel was always held in hand which serves as her warning indicator.</p>
        <p>“Let’s go,” the anonymous boy motioned GemGem to follow him.</p>
        <p>They walked through Artem Street where all the galleries could be seen. AA Art Museum displayed the most amazing art she had ever seen. The Sorceress took a mental note to drop by the gallery before she left the Kingdom. The block next to it had a sign saying “Kiki’s gallery”. The exterior brick wall had a colorful and warm water color art-piece professionally framed that called for people to drop in. GemGem’s now-employer-and-guide mentioned that Kiki was the only artist in town and the gallery was dedicated to her pieces. The last gallery was of the unattired. Nothing more of the place was spoken of. Both of them focused their vision ahead, making sure not to spare a single glance at the questionable block.</p>
        <p>A left turn into Voluptatum Street, where games and anime theatres could be seen, amazed the Sorceress. The street was truly for pleasure and anyone would find it hard to leave. She tried to ignore all of the temptations and strolled straight ahead with the boy out of the border and into the slums where a Church stood nearby.</p>
        <p>“This here, is what I need your help with,” he pointed to the slums. “Your vast knowledge of anime makes you one of the few people who knows what this medium could accomplish, but those people in the Otome and JoJo slums are dragging us down. We need your help in getting rid of them,” the boy ended his sentence by moving his finger to point at a sign that read ‘Lady Kilkie’s Church’</p>
        <p>Not a second later, a curly, medium-length haired brunette in a rich embroidery dress came walking out of said church, “What are you doing here, JamFox?” the woman demanded.</p>
        <p>“Milady Kilkie, I’m here to give my… <em>friend</em> here a small tour,” JamFox, assuming that was his name, bowed to the high ranking brunette.</p>
        <p>“It’s Lady <em>Kikile</em> to you, you stupid idiot. I know you purposely built my sign wrong to get on my nerves,” Lady Kikile huffed. “Ah, now who is that person behind you?” she inquired after noticing the staff-wielding stranger.</p>
        <p>“As I said, she’s my friend.”</p>
        <p>“A girl!” Lady Kikile clasped her hand in delight. “JamFox, you leave right this instant and leave me alone with her,” she ordered.</p>
        <p>“No way am I letting you instill your otome game trash in her.”</p>
        <p>“Umm….” GemGem let out a small voice “There must have been some misunderstanding,” her voice directed at the boy. “I have watched a lot of anime, that is the truth, but I also like otome games….”</p>
        <p>“A friend!” Lady Kikile gleefully ran up to embrace the new woman in town.</p>
        <p>“WHAT!?” JamFox who had the opposite reaction, shouted in surprise. He took several steps back in order to keep his distance from the two women, ”YOU’RE FIRED!” and ran off into the distance leaving both women puzzled.</p>
        <p><em>What luck</em>, GemGem thought after a long pause. She had been longing for a female friend to talk about her hobbies with, but in turn accidentally lost her one and only job on the spot. She glanced at the glowing jewel in hand and knew she had to do something before moving out from this Kingdom. “Lady Kikile,” the Sorceress gathered all her courage, “how could I have an audience with the King?”</p>
        <p>“Excuse me?” the question caught the lady off guard.</p>
        <p>Both of them knew how hard and long of a wait it was to gain approval for an audience with the King of Weebs. According to the scrolls, the King wasn’t of royal blood and had worked his way up with the help of his friends, but that didn’t mean he would agree to meet any random stranger, not to mention a new face in town.</p>
        <p>“Please,” GemGem begged with a determined voice.</p>
        <p>Lady Kikile observed the new woman long and hard. She pondered for several minutes, which felt like an eternity, as a gust of wind blew by and small kids ran around the area.</p>
        <p>****************************</p>
        <p>The gigantic pure white exterior of the palace was something to behold of. The interior was grander, paintings of His Weebness’ favorite anime characters were hanging on the walls, red curtains were hanging and luxurious carpet dressed the hallway, and ornaments were meticulously placed around the palace.</p>
        <p>“I’m doing you a favor because you looked desperate and we have the same husbando. Use your time wisely,” Lady Kikile lead GemGem through the hallway. She seemed to know the ins and outs of the castle and was of a higher rank than the Sorceress was lead to believe.</p>
        <p>A pair of wooden doors stood before them at the end of the corridor. Two royal guards towered over them at each end of the corridor. A dirty blond haired Knight stood on the left while a half-human-half-cow brunet Knight stood on the right. It only took them a second to recognize Lady Kikile before quickly pushing the door open for her.</p>
        <p>“Ser Unit, please bring out His Weebness this instant. My friend here has an urgent matter which requires his immediate attention,” she spoke on the top of her lungs to the black haired Knight in glasses who stood next to the throne.</p>
        <p>The Knight turned his attention to GemGem who was still holding her staff, “You’re a Sorceress?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, Ser”</p>
        <p>“Only people who have seen a great amount of anime and applied the knowledge  to spells could achieve that title. A lot have tried, but only a few succeed,” he commented in awe. “Are you looking to be Court Sorceress?”</p>
        <p>“Excuse me?” GemGem was taken aback by the sudden question. In normal circumstances, she would be overjoyed by the proposal, but this was not the time.</p>
        <p>“Ser Unit! We’re not here for that!” Kikile backed her new friend up, “Though that would be a good discussion for later, since apparently she finds herself needing a job.”</p>
        <p>“Apologies, I assumed you are here to apply for the position because we are currently searching for one. I’ll go grab the King,” he turned his back to the two women and disappeared behind the curtains.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, a dark long haired man stepped out into the light. He was wearing red and gold silk with a coat of white fur that covered his shoulder.</p>
        <p>GemGem kneeled down on one knee and spoke, “Your Weebness, I believe JamFox is planning a coup.”</p>
        <p><strong>CHAPTER 4 - SER JAMFOX</strong></p>
        <p>“To hell with that Sorceress!” a light-brown haired boy slammed his fist on a wooden table. He was standing alone in a house miles away from civilization. The view from his window perfectly framed the busy market in the Kingdom of Weebs. “To think she fell into the Cycle of an Anime Fan trap. I must change my approach.”</p>
        <p>The famous cycle stated that a person will find all anime amazing when they first try the medium. They would get addicted and try to find even better anime to watch, eventually they would come across the classic 90s - the era elitists praise. They fall prey to becoming elitists themselves, then after they have consumed an unspeakable amount of anime, they stop caring and only watch for enjoyment.</p>
        <p>JamFox, cunning as his name implied, had been planning a coup against the Kingdom of Weebs. An elitist who stood by his own beliefs with a burning passion and who looked to reform the Kingdom to how he thought it should be. His desire was to educate all civilians on the greatness of the classics and make them realize how low of a standard present day anime had become. He planned to revolutionize the industry, ultimately bringing back meaningful anime.</p>
        <p>Initially, he traveled to the famous Kingdom of Weebs to seek people with similar mindsets. Only a few people received his interest and were worth conversing with. Despite that, he was content. “A few close friends is better than a hundred acquaintances,” he thought. Due to that, he never moved into the Kingdom. He found a quaint place just far enough from the kingdom to make an easy trip back and forth when he felt like it.</p>
        <p>Once JamFox felt comfortable visiting the Kingdom everyday, he decided to open a brewery to cure his thirst for quality whiskey and a gym to satisfy his need to stay fit. Both locations had increasingly gained popularity amongst the people, despite a lack of gym participants. Words about JamFox’s efforts spread to the King’s ear and eventually, he was knighted as Ser JamFox for all of his accomplishments.</p>
        <p>A thought occurred to the boy how easy it was for him to gain such a title. “Ser” wouldn’t be given to everyone and normally men would have to enroll as a knight to receive it. JamFox, on the other hand, simply did what he wanted in the Kingdom and got knighted along the way. Countless ideas raced through his mind how he could try to change this Kingdom for the better.</p>
        <p>****************************</p>
        <p>“Here’s an interesting guy,” a brunet who looked a few years younger than JamFox handed him a stack of paper. “My research says he’s still new to anime so we could make good use of him. Plus, he has an interesting ability.”</p>
        <p>JamFox’s eyes scanned over the document full of personal information on a young boy named Cade. It was a wonder to him how the brunet scholar even came across classified information. He was correct on how the Sorceress was knowledgeable and the documents on her were also on point, unfortunately they forgot to factor in her interests and taste in anime which were impossible to find.</p>
        <p>A week few weeks later, Cade was sitting across JamFox in his house outside the Kingdom. The boy tried to come off as cool but failed as his eyes shot left and right to observe his surroundings.</p>
        <p>“Cade, I’m overjoyed that you decided to give me a visit,” the calculating box clasped his hands together on the table as if holding an interview.</p>
        <p>“Who wouldn’t after you said <em>that</em>,” the young boy defended himself. “How did you even get that information? No one knows about it.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, anything is possible with money.” A convincing lie. Cade looked uncomfortable knowing his personal information was bought but he took the bait.</p>
        <p>JamFox took the young boy’s silence as an acceptable answer to move on. He preached his ideals to Cade and dropped little sweet talk at how intelligent he he thought the boy was and showed how similar their tastes in anime were. Cade may not have seen much anime yet, but JamFox could see the huge potential in him.</p>
        <p>A few days later, JamFox got himself an ally.</p>
        <p>****************************</p>
        <p>“Why this girl?” the cunning revolutionist tilted his head. He was reading through scrolls on a woman named Zelda who lived in a fallen land.</p>
        <p>His loyal brunet friend stood by the entrance door who was ready to leave nonchalantly replied, “She seems like one of our kind. I could be off on this one as well, but even if we were wrong in our judgement, won’t it feel good helping out a fellow human in need?”</p>
        <p>JamFox sighed. He did not believe Zelda will help him in his grand plans, but his friend was right, the girl needed help. He lured her into the Kingdom of Weebs and if she felt an inclination to help him out of gratitude, that would be an ideal outcome.</p>
        <p>Closing notes: <em>Chapters 5-11 were never finished due to some server-wide drama related to the temporary leaving of the server by Kiki. Unfortunately after that the drama, the server started to fall apart little by little. The convos shortened, the tensions rose and everyone got &quot;busier&quot;.</em></p>
        <h2>Miscellaneus bits and snippets</h2>
        <p>There were quite a few little day to day moments that don't really fit into the whole 'narrative' but are still worth noting.</p>
        <h3>Three-way simultaneous anime contract</h3>
        <p>Drama-plague ravaged the lands of the Kingdom, but I tried to revive what I could by suggesting a contract event. Everyone would recommend 1 anime to the pool and we would randomly assign who would get to watch what. Then we would watch 1 episode a day and talk about our thoughts. The discussion channel was deleted, but I managed to save 2 pictures of the &quot;what I watched/expected/got&quot; thing we did at the end.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Fish taped to ATM: An analysis]]></title>

        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>&quot;hey COMMONWEATH bank, how about you SERVICE your FUCKING atms in BUNBURY so punters like ME will not hav to TAPE FISH to them so youll have NO CHOICE but to come and FIX THEM. i have more fish and tape and will,, power than youre intire organistation. FIX THEM NOW.&quot;</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A year or two ago this image of a fish taped to an ATM went into the circulation of funny forum pictures and today I invite you to take a closer look at it. What seems like an ordinary citizen expressing his discontent, to put it lightly, towards his banking company of choice may not be as simple when you inspect it a second time. In fact, I will argue that it is not just a regular picture posted to gather upvotes and likes from amused scrollers - what is really behind this image is a carefully orchestrated plot to hide some sharp commentary on the modern consumerist and capitalist mindset in plain sight.</p>
        <p>Consider the tones used here - deep blues, nostalgia inducing purples and a dash of good old streetlight-orange tones. And all of this in a bleak and dark evening. Why <em>was</em> this shot taken in the evening? Well, most people would associate darkness and nights with less than pleasurable emotions. The dark atmosphere invokes feelings way different from what the same picture in daylight would have. The ATM is a symbol in this case, as is the night. The author clearly has quite the negative view on materialism and that is why night was used - he associates negative emotions with modern materialist philosophy. This interplay between the clashing and, at the same time, complimenting colours together with the dirty ATM and the bright, almost clinical lamp invokes this feeling of unsettling discomfort. You could almost mistake the reality of standing behind this ATM with an eerie feeling, as if you're about to pass out on a dirty blackmarket operating table while some masked figures prepare to take your organs. &quot;Maybe it's not all that bad? Maybe the author just loves evenings?&quot; you say. Very reasonable! I myself love rain and evenings more than sunshine so the idea crossed my mind. However, when we get more into this image, that conclusion will lose its leg to stand on. Besides it's rare that the symbols used in art are of personal origin - in art, symbols are usually used with their common meaning. Symbols are used just like words in a language. Each being has their own symbols, but when communicating, the symbols are translated and switched for their universally known counterparts. It's no use trying to argue that &quot;cat&quot; means something else than the small domesticated carnivorous bastard with soft fur, a short snout, and retractable claws, so in a similar way it's not practical to argue that the night symbol means something else than what is universally understood.</p>
        <p>But make no mistake, as pretty as the colours are, this image is doctored - this is evident from the white values of the bright rectangular lamp. When did you last see a blue lamp on an ATM? Thought so, it's always either neutral white or with a hint of yellow. The reason for this alteration serves an important purpose besides giving it a unique and almost professional look to attract more attention among the low quality pictures. It's a homage to Vaporwave, also an artstyle that is deeply sceptical of consumerism. By adjusting the colours a little, the author has given the image a whole new layer. Just imagine, if you just took away the context of an angry citizen rambling about broken ATMs and that fish, wouldn't it fit in outrun and vaporwave galleries quite nicely? In Vaporwave, purple and blue colours are a defining part of its style, as are the clunky old computer interfaces - like our ATM has in the image. It's all about those orange sunsets and purple neons and in combination with the clunky 80s and 90s machinery it gives this weird yearning for a time that never was in almost a mocking way.</p>
        <p>Another characteristic of Vaporwave are blatant abrupt copy-pasted elements in its art - be it samples from old songs and excerpts from commercials in its songs or badly cut out images of Fiji water bottles and roman sculptures in its images. Speaking of blatant abrupt pasted elements in art, that brings me to the elephant in the room, or rather the fish taped onto the ATM. The fish is, I can say with confidence, a Blueback herring - a sensational choice! You can verify that it is in fact a Blueback herring by going out and catching one yourself to compare it to the image. But moving on, you have probably heard about the red herring - something obvious or catching that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important question, usually used as a logical fallacy or a literary device. What would the opposite of a red herring be? A blue herring - just like the one used here. So turning red herrings meaning on its head, the blue herring would be something obvious or catching that leads or guides us to a relevant or important question. This works on a superficial level as well as in a deeper one. The fish was taped there to bring attention to the broken ATM. Or, the blue herring is pointing to the consumerism and capitalism saying: &quot;This system is fishy and broken. It is flawed and it is not working for humans, rather it's holding humans back.&quot; Simply brilliant!</p>
        <p>Lastly, consider the tape that was used - it's without a doubt the Magtape Matt 25mm x 50m. You can easily figure this out by looking at the way the tape bends, by its texture and the lighter underside and then comparing these qualities at your local hardware store. And you can see it's 25mm by knowing that the average ATM has buttons sized around 20-25mm. But to appreciate this choice you have to get into the mindset of the author. The previous secrets I have revealed to you about the image have been essentially hidden behind symbols and metaphors and this piece of tape is a symbol for all that. Symbol inside the symbols! The tape symbolises masking and hiding the truth. That's why the tape is black on the surface and light on the underside. Most of the times things aren't as they seem on the surface and that's especially the case with capitalism which is what the picture is trying to warn against. What might seem like an ordinary piece of tape that will aid your daily tasks at first will turn out to chain you to the devil that is money. Sounds familiar? Well, that's probably because it's similar to the way the fish is chained to the ATM.</p>
        <p>There you go, no need to thank me. I have explored and explained some, but not all, of the secrets this geinus work of art is housing. Now it's your turn to fill the gaps I left.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>The local store Saue Kaubakeskus, where Marek bought his tickets from. Author: Peep Mahl</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In Saue, Estonia a local man lost the lottery. The man, named Marek-Ein Kallap, had all of his hopes and dreams torn to pieces - quite like his ticket when he shredded it - when he lost out on a whopping 20203,30€!</p>
        <p>He tried his luck on a sunny Sunday - as he always has been doing for years - by buying the latest Bingo lottery ticket from a local store. March 17th was the day when he forfeited some of his money in cash for two tickets.</p>
        <p>&quot;He's quite a sympathetic man, he comes here quite often. Shame that he didn't win, I guess… You know, I was sure he was gonna win it this time,&quot; said Marta Poolak, the local store's clerk.</p>
        <p>Marek explained to us that he never buys from the internet - he does not trust virtual money.</p>
        <p>&quot;I think I lost because I didn't buy the damn tickets from the computer. Most of the past winners have been from the internetwebs. It must be rigged, I-I'm telling you!&quot; exclaimed Marek during our interview following his great disappointment.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>Apartment where Marek's yellow couch resides in. Author: Peep Mahl</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He was sitting on his leather couch with a slight tingle in his hands as he watched the show &quot;The Great Lotto-Wednesday&quot; live on March 20th. As the numbers came flying to the screen one by one the tingle in his hands turned into a violent shake, Marek described to us.</p>
        <p>&quot;The first two numbers were mine! I WAS SO CLOSE! But I fucking knew it was rigged when the third number didn't match mine. Man, those computers have ruined humanity…&quot;</p>
        <p>Be that as it may, lady luck did not smile to Marek that day.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Üksildus ja iseseisvus Murakami &quot;Kafka mererannas&quot;]]></title>
      <link>https://jamfox.dev/blog/uksildus-ja-iseseisvus/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Kõige aktuaalsem teema, mida “Kafka mererannas” käsitles, oli üksildus ja sellega toimetulek. Meedia on mõnda aega juba külvanud uuringute ja statistika põhjal hirmu ja segadust inimestesse, rääkides, et tänapäeva noored elavad iivele ohtlikult tagasihoidlikku suguelu ning on üksildasemad ja depressiivsemad kui kunagi varem. Ei saa öelda, et raamatu tegelased oleks olnud läbinisti depressiivsed, kuid üksikud olid nad kindlasti ning nende lahendused sellega toime tulekuks sarnased tänapäevaste lahendustega. Murakami näitab teoses nende lahenduste nõrkusi ja tugevusi.</p>
        <p>Peategelase Kafka vastus üksildusega toimetulekuks oli saada võimalikult iseseisvaks. See tundus talle loogilisena, sest klassikaaslased teda ei mõistnud, ema ja õde olid talle võõrad ning isa tõi talle vaid meelehärmi oma vähese tähelepanuga, mida ta Kafkale jagas. Niisiis tegi Kafka hoolega trenni, et ei peaks füüsilise jõu pärast kelleltki abi paluma; luges raamatuid, et saada vastuseid teda painavatele küsimustele ja lohutust eskapismi kujul; vältis toetumast kellelegi teisele kui endale. Ei saa öelda, et tänapäeva noored üleliia palju sporti teeks ja raamatuid loeks, aga probleemidega toime tulemise osas on neil siiski varuks sarnased vastused – ühel või teisel põhjusel proovitakse kõiki probleeme üksi lahendada ning kui sellega toime ei tulda, varjutakse meelelahutuse ning sotsiaalmeedia taha peitu. Iroonilisel kombel toidab sotsiaalmeedia just seda mõtteviisi, et kõigil läheb hästi ja teistel probleeme pole. See on petlik - lihtsalt keegi ei jaga nii avalikult enda vaimseid tagamaid.</p>
        <p>Mingil tasandil teadis Kafka kindlasti, et täiesti üksi hakkama ei saa, kuid ta proovis ka sellest tõsiasjast jagu saada, luues enda kujutelmas noormehe, keda hüütakse rongaks. See, nii-öelda teine mina, mille Kafka endale lõi, pakkus talle raskuste ajal tarkust, head nõu ja vaprust. Huvitaval kombel suudab Kafka endale teadmata saavutada kontakti ka mõne päris inimesega. Näiteks kohtub ta kodust põgenedes bussi peal endavanuse tüdruku Sakuraga, kes talle oma telefoninumbri annab ning kellega ta tundub läbi saavat, kuid otsustab siiski üksinda oma teekonda jätkata. Sakuraga võtab ta siiski hiljem ühendust ning üheks õhtuks aktsepteerib Sakura abivalmidust,. Kartes talle tüli teha ja ise liigse usalduse tagajärjel haiget saada, mõtleb Kafka siiski jälle ümber ning põgeneb taas üksi oma suure kotiga. Selline edasi-tagasi tammumine ja otsustusvõimetus on üsna sarnane tänapäevaste mõtteviisidega. Kardetakse, et kui ei olda kogu aeg rõõmsad ja ei räägita aina sellest, mis maailmas toredat, siis ollakse oma lähedastele tüliks probleemide ja negatiivse mõtteviisiga. Võibolla pisut puistatakse südant, kuid kohe peale seda öeldakse, et tegelikult saadakse ise hakkama ning siis peitutakse enda sisse ja proovitakse oma probleemidega ise hakkama saada.</p>
        <p>Saeki ja tema lugu on teoses suurimaks hoiatuseks eelmainitud sissetõmbumise kui ka liigse sõltuvuse eest. Saeki ja tema armuke olid nagu üks hing, nad olid lahutamatud ning nende kooselu tegi nende elu ideaalseks. Nad sõltusid üksteisest niivõrd palju, et kui Saeki jäi oma armukese surma tõttu üksi, siis kaotas ta oma elu mõtte. Ka tema põgeneb oma probleemide eest, mis teda piinama hakkavad, kui tema armuke sureb, ning proovib üksi hakkama saada. Selle tagajärjel “jäi Saeki aeg seisma,” kui Oshima sõnu laenata ning lõpuks sooritab Saeki ka enesetapu. Esiteks näitab Murakami Saekiga ära äärmusliku juhtumi sellest, kuidas ühelegi asjale ega inimesele ei saa liialt toetuda, sest kui see toetuspunkt peaks katkema, siis võib see viia tõsise traumani. Teiseks näitab ta aga, et ilma abita ei ole võimalik probleemidest jagu saada.</p>
        <p>Teose vastus üksildusega toimetulekuks on tulla mõistmisele, et ka teistel on probleemid ning kõik on vähemal või rohkemal määral sarnaste küsimustega rinda pistnud. Seega peab lihtsalt suhtlema ning usaldama teisi. Kafka saab tuttavaks Oshimaga, kes pärast mitut proovi suudab Kafka usalduse võita. Oshima on Kafka jaoks mentor ning keegi, kes lõppkokkuvõtteks väärib tänu Kafka arengu eest - just tänu Oshimale suudab Kafka lõpuks mõista inimsuhete tähtsust ning lasta vabaks täielikust iseseisvusest. Teos näitab, kui tähtis iseseisvus on, kuid samas toob välja, et see ei tohiks tulla suhete arvelt. Murakami arvates tuleb iseseisvus nii isiklikust vastupidavusest kui ka julgusest teistele toetuda ja end teistele haavatavaks teha.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Just Turn Your Brain Off]]></title>
      <link>https://jamfox.dev/blog/turn-your-brain-off/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>So there I was, at the intermission of &quot;The life and the love&quot; - a play, adapted from a book of the same name - exchanging thoughts about it with my brother. We both deemed it to be bad. I explained it to be disrespectful to the audience by slapping them over the face with overblown acting and repeated sentences, as if the audience were of 5-year-olds and needed to be handed the meaning and all exposition on a silver platter. For goodness sake, just look at the title, what do you think it's about? The lack of subtlety, it's unbearable. It's so uninspired and directly states what the show is about, god forbid the audience might misunderstand it! My brother said he didn't quite understand why he didn't like it, but he was bored and said he understood where I was coming from.</p>
        <p>Then we joined mum and pops, who had run into some old friends of theirs. We didn't quite join in their conversation, just stood in the same circle making fun of the play by ourselves. Until we were overheard and asked &quot;So I gather you didn't like it?&quot; So I explained myself. I said I found it trash, to be exact with my word choice, and explained my reasons and then quickly asked for their perspective. Instead I was met with &quot;You might be too young,&quot; so I asked them to explain why that might be, what I might be missing, I was desperate to understand. Instead of getting an answer, we fell into a vicious cycle of me asking for their perspective and them just avoiding the answer and saying a variant of &quot;Oh I didn't understand it either when I was your age,&quot; or &quot;You just don't see it.&quot; I felt like a joke. Finally, after a while, I got my answer. Which was that they enjoyed getting a break from the mundane. Just dressing up, driving a hour to the theatre and enjoying a cup of coffee at the intermission was a pleasure in itself and it didn't matter how on-the-nose the piece was. The piece needn't be complicated or thought-provoking, that wasn't the point. They seemed a tad upset about the conversation, but I thanked them for their perspective and we went on to see the second half of the play.</p>
        <p>Later mum brought out that I had come off as arrogant. She said that has known me long enough to &quot;tolerate my rants about higher art and all that other weird stuff,&quot; but that others might misunderstand me and see me as aggressive. Pops cited Dale Carnegie's &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; and said that it would do me well to avoid strong emotions when discussing such things, as it might be seen as an attack against their emotions rather than a discussion about the play. That got me to take a step back and think. This is the third time this month. When did I get so emotional about discussing art? Have I finally become a full-blown cynic? Am I in the wrong?</p>
        <h3>The life and the art</h3>
        <p>It's not like I think of myself as the smartest in the room, so to say. I truly am willing to hear out every opinion and accept them when I don't agree with them. However, again and again I do find myself being the only one in the room that has any capacity to express themselves. I am stupid, but there rarely is anyone that is able to put it into words.</p>
        <p>&quot;You are stupid&quot; Okay, that is all well and good, but would you please elaborate? &quot;Uhh, I don't know, you just are, <strong>that's how I feel, it doesn't have to be complicated.&quot;</strong></p>
        <p>Just throwing around statements out of emotion with no explanation is no grounds for a meaningful discussion. How on earth is anyone to understand one if they are not able to explain the root of their emotion. If you <em>feel</em> that &quot;Alita Battle Angel&quot; was good then you need to find what gave rise to that feel. If you <em>feel</em> that &quot;Thus spoke Zarathustra&quot; was bad then you need to find the words to explain why you felt like it. Even the basics of argumentation theory would suffice:</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory">&quot;Typically an argument has an internal structure, comprising the following</a></p>
        <ol>
        <li>a set of assumptions or premises</li>
        <li>a method of reasoning or deduction and</li>
        <li>a conclusion or point.&quot;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>No need for anything complicated. Just three sentences and that already can set one on the way to becoming understandable. So, what good is a genius that is only able to mutter a single sentence about how he feels about any one thing? The genius might as well be the dumbest in the room, because no-one may ever know what they're thinking. If they possess no capacity to express their geniosity then what worth does it have? Basking in their bubble of subconscious self-admiration has no value in my eyes.</p>
        <p>So I guess the reason I've been so emotional about the art lately is because I've grown tired. I have grown tired of prefacing and ending all of my sentences with &quot;that's just my opinion&quot; when it should be obvious that anything that leaves my mouth is my opinion. I have grown tired of pouring my heart out and explaining my view points only to get responses like &quot;I feel otherwise, I can't explain it though&quot; &quot;Don't overthink it&quot; &quot;Just turn your brain off&quot; &quot;I hate analysing, don't make it complicated&quot; and so on and on and on and on... I think I have latently went on the offensive to force a response. Maybe if I choose the emotional attack vector they will be forced to express themselves with more than a single sentence. It might have become, without acknowledging it to myself, the new default. I know it's wrong, now I see it. I let my emotions get the best of me. I lived and learned.</p>
        <h3>&quot;You are just different&quot;</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Consider this: You're just different, you've always looked at things from a different light. You've always been ahead of your age. You are always meticulous and comprehensive, disciplined and analytical. You were born like this and you can't expect these things to be the norm. Everyone has their strengths and shortcomings. These qualities happen to be your strengths and you can't blame others for these qualities may be their weaknesses.&quot;</p>
        <p>Me mum, in response to the discussion at the intermission.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Is this really it? Can we really attribute all the work I have put into becoming the best version of myself to some strands of DNA? Literally everyone around me has access to the collective knowledge of all humankind - internet, libraries, book stores, psychologists, anything. All the resources that I have went through to learn what I know, to be what I am, are available to everyone at no cost. I am nothing special, I have not invented my way of thinking, my way of life - I have copied the masters, borrowed pieces from them. Now I am like a mosaic, with pieces borrowed and synthesized from a myriad of artists, thinkers and idiots alike. What part of it was I born with? What is it about me that others can not have?</p>
        <p>I would like to think that the ability to express oneself should be something universal. The skill that should be learned by every single thinking creature. And I am vehemently against saying that self-expression is something that only a few blessed are born with. <strong>Self-expression is a skill and as such it is acquirable by everyone</strong>. I was horrible at explaining things until I started putting in the work. I remember vividly setting a new goal for the school year when I stepped into 10th grade. I was 16 years old at the time and I was having a hard time in the Literature class. On the one hand I loved &quot;the difficult books, classics or whatever,&quot; but on the other hand I was unable to clearly explain why I loved them. Analysing was hard too, I felt like I understood the books I read, but I was stumped by actually writing about it. It wasn't until I acknowledged that I had a shortcoming that could be overcome that I started improving. I started reading about it, learning about how others express themselves and then tried my best to write in a way that others could understand me. Over three years my Literature class essays have went from C-s and D-s to a stable A-s. I learned self-expression, I wasn't born with it.</p>
        <p>So am I really &quot;just different&quot; for wanting everyone to articulate their feelings and thoughts?</p>

      <title><![CDATA[January 2019 Quantified]]></title>
      <link>https://jamfox.dev/blog/january-2019-quantified/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>So, at the start of this year I wanted to try something I've been meaning to for a loooong time - I wanted to track <em>everything</em> I was doing. Every book read, movie watched, times gone to the toilet, hours spent on homework - every-everything as a statistic. Two reasons:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>It was an interesting fantasy of mine at a young age to get life statistics when I die. Having my whole life flash before my eyes, then feel it fade as my soul stumbles through the abyss into the 'afterlife' and being greeted by a statistics wall. It would be a grey wall with a huge number of colourful lists and statistics that I could observe and analyse. An old curiosity satisfied essentially.</li>
        <li>You can't learn from what you can't observe. By collecting data about myself I may discover things about myself that might otherwise remain behind a shrouded curtain of mystery. I want to truly <em>see</em> how I spent my time. I had a lot of hypotheses about how much I spent gaming and how much time I spent socializing, but I didn't know for sure.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So here I am, me - the person who's constantly on a crusade to teach people about the importance of internet privacy, telling you the details of my month. Ironic in a way, but this time it's me giving info and not Google taking it by force I guess ¯_(ツ)_/ ¯</p>
        <p>If you'd like to try something similar look up &quot;quantified self,&quot; there's quite a few resources on it. I also suggest brushing up on internet privacy while you're at it to avoid giving your data to random apps and pages that capitalize on this movement.</p>
        <h2>The Big Sheet</h2>
        <p>So before new years I crawled around the world-wide-interwebs to find a way to track my day, thus landing on quite a few template sheets on reddit. Credit for the best template I could find goes to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kewpit">/u/kewpit.</a></p>

        <ul>
        <li>Sleep: Self-explanatory.</li>
        <li>Downtime: Healthy alone downtime, which means time spent relaxing that isn't gaming or surfing the net for the giggles. Chilling and eating food, meditating, walking the dog, watching shows or movies etc.</li>
        <li>Classes: Time I actually paid attention in class.</li>
        <li>Internet: Both useful (research, learning) and useless (reddit and youtube) browsing. Writing for the blog doesn't apply here.</li>

        <li>Family Time: Meaningful time with family - gatherings, family meetings, late night philosophy discussion with pops and a pair of whiskey glasses and stuff like that. (Note: I live with my family.)</li>
        <li>Homework: Self-explanatory.</li>
        <li>Waste time: Time wasted on commuting, waiting or being hungover etc, where the time spent can't be considered healthy relaxation and where I didn't do anything of use.</li>

        <li>Events 7 hours</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sleep</h3>
        <p>36.4% of my month or 271 hours were spent sleeping. That's a daily average of 8.74 hours - a mighty fine number if I do say so myself. It's a definite improvement from last year, but that's to be expected as I have learned quite a lot about the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep">importance of sleep</a> in the past half a year. When's the last time you slept over 6 hours?</p>
        <p>The first week on the graph starting from January 1st Tuesday to January 6th was the winter break, so it's a little hectic there. After the break starting from the 13th I decided to set up a strict schedule: when the clock hit 21:00 I would read a book and then go to sleep when it hit 22:00. In a week I found myself feeling like my day was short a hour each day - kinda wanted an extra hour here or there to finish up some things or relax some. So I shifted the times a hour ahead from original plan - now 22:00 was the book time and 23:00 was sleep. I saw that I didn't really need 9 hours of sleep and 8 was plenty enough. It's been rock solid so far, save for a few parties, and it's been great! Having a schedule has been hugely transformative - I have way more energy and feel clear-headed most of the time. From the outside I might look like a fucking robot, but from the inside I have the brightest smile ever.</p>
        <h3>Downtime</h3>
        <p>In total I watched 6 movies, 5 anime, 1 series and listened to 2 podcast episodes. These, along with my other relaxation activities took up 15.1% of my time or 112 hours. Quite a percentage! But I can't imagine cutting it shorter, save for some fridays and weekends where I tend to loiter around more than I should. Though, I have been thinking that I should maybe be consuming less and writing more, otherwise I just watch and forget. Definitely a thinking point, there is some potential here to reorganize how I spend my time relaxing.</p>
        <p><strong>Movies:</strong> Time spent watching ~11h 10min. In total I watched 6 movies, of which I watched 5 at home and 1 at the cinema.</p>
        <p>At home I watched:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Enter the Void (7/10) [Directed by Gaspar Noé] -</em> This was an extremely unique experience. I can't quite remember the themes (fuck, I should really write my thoughts right when I finish these), but I remember my emotions viscerally. It was an off-putting, but at the same time charming experience in the most twisted ways. Essentially it's of a junkie's perspective as a ghost after his death and how he observes his loved one's mourning and falling apart emotionally. It's cinematography and structure are unlike anything I've seen. Regarding the structure of it, there's an amusing story that perfectly captures how weird it is. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8mj8kp/in_defense_of_gasper_no%C3%A9s_enter_the_void_2009/dzol2ei/">It's been told that in one of the early screenings he accidentally switched two of the reels in the middle. According to Noe, the audience never noticed anything was amiss, and he himself said it &quot;didn't really make a difference.&quot;</a> It's so surreal by also being very tangible at the same time. If you aren't high when starting this, you will be after finishing it.</li>
        <li><em>Gifted (7/10) [Directed by Marc Webb] -</em> Imagine a child prodigy, a genius able to achieve mental feats greater than the greatest of even adults decorated with multiple PhDs. Is the child obligated to channel their abilities for the greater good of humanity? Or are they supposed to live normal lives? The movie explores both of these questions by giving a taste of both extremes and then, for the end, slaps the viewer right in the face with a clear-cut boring answer of: it's a mix of both that's healthy. But ignoring that, it's oh-so-charming - just watching the father-daughter relationship makes it worthwhile, there were two adorable moments that made me smile ear-to-ear and close to tearing up (A huge achievement by itself!).</li>
        <li><em>Patlabor The Movie (6/10) [Directed by Mamoru Oshii]-</em> Mamuro Oshii as the director was enough to get me to watch it even after dropping the original OVA. But... I was disappointed. There were a few very clear Oshii-moments like the montages of the two detectives searching through the city with shots of the cityscape and streets overlaid by the always brilliant music of Kenji Kawai. Other than that it falls flat. It tries to incorporate and mix together the light and fun moments from the original OVA with Oshii's ideas and styles, but the former sadly takes the prominent role. It ended up being quite a let down, but it was made competently enough I guess. Most of my gripes with the movie could've been of my high expectations.</li>
        <li><em>Patlabor The Movie 2 (8/10) [Directed by Mamoru Oshii] -</em> Almost skipped this one after seeing the first, but I already had it downloaded and I had heard better things of this than the first one and boy am I glad, THIS is what I was looking for when I started watching the first one. It's a really well-animated slow-burn dialogue-heavy political mystery and this time with the light parts stripped out. Such a satisfying movie.</li>
        <li><em>Liz and the Blue Bird (7/10) [Directed by Naoko Yamada] -</em> Perfectly cohesive drama about the usual topics of anime, that is the difficulty of communication and love. I can't quite criticize anything about this and at the same time it's the very thing that makes it just a bit lackluster - it's too safe and simple. No, actually, it's just plain boring and even frustrating at times. HOWEVER the sound design, let me tell you, is off the charts. I really want to give it a 5, but the this is the part that keeps tugging at me to up the score to a 7. Anything from the simple sounds of feet striking the ground to the orchestral piece made just for the movie are just so insanely perfect. Worth it for that alone, but other than that... Eh.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the cinema I watched:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Green Book (8/10) [Directed by Peter Farrelly] -</em> This was a HUGE surprise. I was basically told &quot;we're watching this, it looks interesting&quot; and I thought &quot;why not, I like to go into movies completely blind once in a while.&quot; Best decision ever. This one's just for fun and it's been criticised for being very simple, but from what I gathered it wasn't even trying to be anything else. I usually hate comedies, with a passion, but this one is different. This is what comedies are supposed to be! But I can see where the confusion may have come from, it walks a fine line between being a unique comedy of sorts, a charming friendship drama with a healthy amount of 60's racial problems mixed in. Go into this expecting a fun time instead of getting a serious commentary about race and you won't be disappointed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Anime:</strong> Time spent watching ~15h 20min. In total I watched 5 anime, of which I completed 1 and dropped 4. The shows I started watching and am still watching were not counted here, thus the seasonal shows are missing here.</p>
        <p>I completed:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Neon Genesis Evangelion (10/10) [Directed by Hideaki Anno]</em> - To put it into perspective: It's the only 10/10 I have ever given. 5th time watching this and I rarely rewatch stuff. I hope to spill my guts about this in depth some time in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I dropped:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Samurai Champloo (7/10) [Directed by Shinichirō Watanabe] -</em> It's fun, it has a unique artstyle and music. But that's kind of it? I respect it for what it is, but I am not the target audience for it. Shinichirō Watanabe is such a weird director, he has made so much different stuff across the board that I find it hard to define his handwriting at times, but that keeps me stumbling into stuff I maybe otherwise wouldn't even try so that may be a good thing.</li>
        <li><em>Kakegurui xx (4/10) [Directed by Yûichirô Hayashi] -</em> More of the same. The first season was a bit goofy and out there which I liked, it also helped that I was craving more of the Darby gambling from Jojo's, but now that that's worn off I can see Kakegurui for what it is. And I don't like it. Big-titty psychos beating their gums over life staking bets, didn't we have enough from the first season already?</li>
        <li><em>Boogiepop wa Warawanai (2019) (5/10) [Directed by Shingo Natsume] -</em> I tried watching the original adaptation a while back and loved it's directing, but didn't really care for the story, but now it's vice versa. The directing is a mess. I'm no stranger to interweaved multiple-timeline plotlines, but this is not how you do it. Just cutting to another timeline like it's part of the one that came before it? It's like trying to navigate a bowl of interdimensional time-traveling spaghetti where some of it is a week old and poisionous and the other part is fresh - how do I tell them apart? And for what purpose is it like this? I guess I'll be missing out on this answer and I'm not that bummed about it - there's quite enough on my 2019 Winter Season plate already.</li>
        <li><em>Rounoni Kenshin (6/10) [Directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi] -</em> I've been told that if I can watch through a hundred episodes of this then I'll be able to experience the most masterful and emotional movie anime has to offer. Well, I didn't make it too far. It's the usual 90's episodic comedy with a ton of on-the-nose moralistic lessons. &quot;Police abusing their power is bad!&quot; &quot;Being evil is bad!&quot; &quot;Violence is bad!&quot; Yeah? Well no shit, anything else you want to say? Sadly not, but at the very least the main cast was quite likeable. I'll still be watching the movie sometime, but I can't see what the big deal around this is.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Podcasts:</strong> Time spent watching 4h 51min from two episodes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Hello Internet</em>: &quot;12 days of HI&quot; - HI is still the only podcast I have listened every episode of and still continue to keep up with. Weird couple of dudes - a robot and a caveman - that talk about anything, everything and nothing.</li>
        <li><em>Corridor Podcast</em>: &quot;Steve the landlord&quot; - I have seen Steve in Corridor Crew vlogs so many times, and like they say, his weird personality combined with his odd life experiences really make it every time. Wasn't much of a surprise to see that he's an artist and hearing his personal stories is in this podcast was a goldmine of unique stories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Series:</strong> Total time watched ~3 hours from 1 completed series:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch (9/10) [Directed by David Slade] -</em> What can I say? I just love meta-textuality. They might've overdone it with the amount of 4th-wall-breaks, but it didn't take much away from the experience. I'm especially fascinated by the circular structure and how the story really has now end. Definitely a fresh idea with a stellar execution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>Classes where I actually paid attention took up 9.7% or 72 hours of my time in January. It was really interesting to see that I spend close to a quarter of my classes surfing the web or reading books. No wonder people puzzle over why I'm not doing anything in class, but am still getting straight A-s. It can't be helped, some of the classes take material so slowly that I am able to do my own things for most of the course and then learn the material in a night or two before the test. History, community and biology classes are the worst in terms of this, it's laughable how I can learn the same material the class as a whole had to process for months in about 2 hours. I see nothing worth changing here.</p>
        <h3>Internet</h3>
        <p>Internet took up 8.3% or 62 hours of my time. That's 2 hours daily. The data here is probably skewed a little because of small phone usage times of like 5-10 minutes that are all too common thoughout the day, but don't count under the main activity that was noted down on any paticular hour. If I paid attention most of the class, but decided to take two 5 minute phone breaks somewhere in there then I would still mark that I spent my time paying attention as that took up most of the hour. I have tracked my time on the phone with an app before though, and there I averaged about 3 hours a day, which isn't <em>that</em> bad to be honest. But even with the skewed results I have gotten better managing my time. I still need to work on it and sometime I'd like to recondition myself to not carry my phone in my pocket at all times.</p>
        <h3>Read/Write</h3>
        <p>Reading and writing took up 7.9% or 59 hours of my time in Januray. Most notably I started reading before going to bed this month and started this blog which have boosted the numbers quite a bit. I have made progress in starting to read even more, but I think I could do with more writing. As I write this in the middle of February, the time spent on reading and writing has increased even further, so I guess that's been going well.</p>
        <p><strong>Books:</strong> In total I read 1222 pages from 6 books, of which I completed 3 and dropped 3.</p>
        <p>I completed:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Chapterhouse - Dune [Written by Frank Herbert] -</em> Here it is. The end of my favorite book series. In Chapterhouse, Frank continued with the style of <em>Heretics of Dune,</em> where he toned down the philosophy heavy aspects from <em>God Emperor of Dune</em> just a tad_,_ while exploring Bene Gesserit in depth. It doesn't reach the heights of God Emperor for me, but is still quite enjoyable. Has an ironic, but a perfect ending to this saga. There's a lot to take away from this book, but the most important lesson that this book helped to internalize for me was how ambivalent and changeable truth and knowledge is. The moment I say I'm sure of something, is the moment where I rob myself the chance to progress. If, however, I have the power to doubt and question all of my knowledge and convictions, then I am able to grow and accept changes as they come. Ahhhh, what a journey, I will definitely re-read this series many a time (Though, I will probably stop at God Emperor when I do). Quotes:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
        <li>_&quot;_Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. <strong>Seek discipline and find your liberty.</strong>&quot;</li>
        <li>“Confine yourself to observing and you always miss the point of your life. The object can be stated this way: Live the best life you can. Life is a game whose rules you learn if you leap into it and play it to the hilt. Otherwise, you are caught off balance, continually surprised by the shifting play. Non-players often whine and complain that luck always passes them by. They refuse to see that they can create some of their own luck.&quot;</li>
        <li>“<strong>Power attracts the corruptible</strong>. Suspect any who seek it.”</li>
        <li>“Show me a completely smooth operation and I'll show you someone who's covering mistakes. <strong>Real boats rock.</strong>”</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Face your fears or they will climb over your back</strong>.”</li>
        <li>“Ready comprehension is often a knee-jerk response and the most dangerous form of understanding. It blinks an opaque screen over your ability to learn. Be warned. <strong>Understand nothing. All comprehension is temporary</strong>.”</li>
        <li>“How tempting it is to raise high walls and keep out change. Rot here in our own self-satisfied comfort.”</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind [Written by Yuval Noah Harari] -</em> A dose of completely new perspectives of human life brought to you by an Israeli historian! You know, as fact-heavy as this book was, I needed to check up on them, because the author seemed to love hand picking examples that fit his statements while mostly ignoring the other side of the arguments he made. After digging around it seems that it's a common gripe with this one and apparently some of it is just plain wrong. But it could be the uncertainty and plasticity of history at play here, rather than incompetence, but best to approach it with a grain of salt and healthy amount of critical thinking as always, I suppose. Ignoring that, there's quite a lot of interesting perspectives explored here. Some of it seems obvious in hindsight, but can be appreciated for putting some unconscious convictions I've had into words. Some of the heavy hitting questions I was left with were: How do you statistically measure happiness? Am I happier than a farmer centuries ago? How much of human progress can be attributed to money and religion? How far has consumerism grown and how will it affect the future?</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
        <li>“You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.”</li>
        <li>“Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. <strong>Whatever is possible is by definition also natural</strong>. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition.”</li>
        <li>“Consistency is the playground of dull minds.”</li>
        <li>“One of history’s few iron laws is that <strong>luxuries tend to become necessities</strong> and to spawn new obligations.”</li>
        <li>“We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.”</li>
        <li>“Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.”</li>
        <li>“Obesity is a double victory for consumerism. Instead of eating little, which will lead to economic contraction, people eat too much and then buy diet products - contributing to economic growth twice over.” “Our language evolved as a way of gossiping.”</li>
        <li>“But the most important finding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the <strong>correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations</strong>.”</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Breakfast of champions [Written by Kurt Vonnegut]</em> - My first exposure to Vonnegut. After reading some opinions about it, it seems like it's a book I should revisit after reading more of his works. But even having missed a number of references I found it extremely good. I've been cooking an idea in my head of how I want to write about it in tandem with Bandersnatch by intertwining two reviews, but it's quite a hard idea realise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I dropped:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Thus spoke Zarathustra [Written by Friedrich Nietzsche] -</em> Probably not a good first exposure to Nietzsche. I've heard and read about Nietzsche's philosophy from 3rd parties quite a bit and I've found much of it agreeable, hence my interest in this book. However, in the end I found it just a tad too difficult as an intro to Nietzsche. I shall return to this one day. Quotes:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
        <li>“One repays a teacher badly if one always remains nothing but a pupil.”</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li><em>The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle [Written by Stuart Turton] -</em> For mystery fans I would imagine this to be wonderful ride. But it seems like the solving of the mystery was the only driving factor of this book. I didn't care much for solving it though, so there wasn't much of anything left for me, which is why I dropped it.</li>
        <li><em>Neuromancer [Written by William Gibson] -</em> Of course I had to see where cyberpunk got it's roots. Most surprisingly I felt at home with all the tech lingo as most of it aligned with that of Shadowrun's. The style of writing wasn't my cup of tea though, so I opted to read a summary of it instead and dropped it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Socialising</h3>
        <p>Socialising took up 6.5% or 48 hours of my time. I spent way less time with friends than I thought, but I guess &quot;tHE pATh tO SuCcEsS iS A lOnELy roAd.&quot; But really, this is common in the winter - I prefer to just stay home than dress up like the Michelin Man and step into the cold. I should definitely write to my friends more though, even if I don't go out as often.</p>
        <p>I went to two parties - New Years and a classmates birthday, saw a play (&quot;Väikekodanlased&quot;), went to a ninja-warrior styled gym, baked waffles with a friend and had 6 DnD sessions.</p>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>I spent 4.3% or 32 hours exercising, of which I spent 13 running, 1 biking and 18 in the gym. That's juuuust a tad over 1 hour every day on average. This is pretty much on how I plan it to be, save for the fact that I want to bike more, but the icy roads were to blame this month. Hit all my goals: hit 10k for running; switched to a new 6 day gym split (I have the opportunity to have a freaking free gym all to myself, of course I'm gonna capitalize on it and train as much as I can!); had no goals for biking, it's just as a support for running.</p>
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>I spent 4.3% or 32 hours of my time gaming. I think this is a huge drop from Fall of 2018, but I have no data from that time so I can't make comparisons. There are a few binges and a hour here and there, so I'd say I've gotten my gaming habits under control.</p>
        <p>I didn't play much but Factorio. One of the most addicting games available, but not maliciously so! It's an open ended puzzle game in the vain of Zachtronics and offers a some mental gymnastics to those that like that sort of stuff. I definitely want to revisit this game and make a separate post about it.</p>
        <h3>Productive</h3>
        <p>I spent a puny 3% or 22 hours being productive. Most of my personal projects were finished in December and I didn't care to find myself anything new during the winter break and opted to just relax and read more books and watch more movies. Then I started this blog as a new project which has also zapped a considerable amount from my time. No excuses though - I should dedicate more of my time to being productive! I have a few goals for February: Start with learning Linux, Arduinos and the Raspberry Pi, possibly even Python if the latter goals require it; write more in this blog; start drawing more again and learn digital art since I haven't used my XP-Pen for a while.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Elas kord üks eriline mees. Ta nimi oli Obama. Obama tegi eriliseks tema ebaharilikult must nahk. Tema nahk oli must sellepärast, et ta oli Õlist sõltuvuses. Õli oli maa seest puuritud haruldane võlujook, mis paneb maailma liikuma. Seda kasutati masinates, aga mitte keegi ei joonud seda. See tähendab - mitte keegi peale Obama. Keegi peale tema ei teadnud, mida Õli inimesega teha võib ja keegi ei hakanud ise järgi kaa proovima, sest see pidavat tapma. Obama oli ülimalt võimas mees. Nimelt ta valitses poolt maailma. Tema maailma pooles valitses kord ja vabadus. Tema rahvas rääkis ilusat kelt ja nende kaup oli üllatavalt odav.</p>
        <p>Obama parim sõber oli veelgi võimsam mees. Tema nimi oli Putin. Ka Putin oli eriline. Tal oli ilus treenitud keha ja ta oli ülimalt vastupidav. Räägitakse, et kõik 7 maailmaimet on Putini tehtud. Nagu Obama, oli ka Putin Õlist sõltuvuses. Mitte küll selle tarbimisest, vaid selle otsimisest ja kaevandamisest ning müümisest. Putin valitses seda teist maailma poolt. Kuid tema maailma pooles ei olnud korda. Putini inimesed olid julged ja natuke peast põrunud. Tema maailma poolel oli kõik tagurpidi. Karud rääkisid ja kandsid mütse ning mängisid akordionit. Nende keel oli väga arusaamatu ja kui sa just seal sündinud polnud, siis seda polnud võimalik ära õppida.</p>
        <p>Oli ka kolmas mees - Toomas Hendrik. Toomas Hendrik oli Obama õpipoiss. Ta oli üpriski arg ja tundus väike Obama ja Putini kõrval, kuid ta oli uudishimulik ja valmis õppima. Toomas Hendrik oli väga hea infotehnoloogia alal. Tema oli see, kes mõtles välja sellise võimsa masina Pii-Si, mis teab kõike ja oskab vastata mis iganes küsimusele.</p>
        <p>Ühel kolmapäeval läks Obama koos Toomas Hendrikuga Putini juurde Õli ostma. Nad saabusid Putini maja ette täpselt kell kolm. Nagu tavaks, ootasid neid ukse ees kolm karu, kes nad sisse juhatasid. Toomas Hendruk kõndis oma Pii-Si-lt pilku tõstmata ringi. Ta ei saanud sellest lahti. Toomas Hendrik teadis, et see on kahjulik, kui ta seda üle kolme tunni vaatab, kuid ta lihtsalt ei saanud sellest lahti. &quot;Saa sellest lahti ükskord juba! Sa oled sinna nagu kinni naelutatud!&quot; ütles Obama. Toomas Hendrik vaid mõmises vastuseks ja nad sammusid edasi. Nad jõudsid ühe suure tuttava ukseni ja kui nad sealt sisse sammusid, leidsid nad sealt õnnetu näoga Putini. Enne kui Obama midagi küsida jõudis, ütles Putin: &quot;Midagi kohutavat on juhtunud!&quot; Obama küsis rahulikult: &quot;Räägi täpsemalt, milles seisneb probleem?&quot; Putin rääkis talle: &quot;Ma ei saa seekord sulle Õli müüa, nimelt rotid on seda sööma hakanud. Igakord, kui ma maa alla Õli tooma lähen, rebivad nad mu kanistrid katki! Ma proovisin neid tappa, kuid see ei õnnestunud, neid on liiga palju. Ma ei tea mida teha.&quot; Obama ja Putin proovisid 3 päeva ise seda lahendada. Nad proovisid nii tulega kui ka veega ja isegi rääkimisega, kuid rotte ei ajanud miski ära. Lõpuks läks Obama Toomas Hendriku juurde ja rääkis talle probleemist ja lisas, et kui Toomas Hendrik leiab Putini probleemile seitsme päevaga lahenduse, saab ta veerandi maailmast. Obama lubas Putinile, et seitsme päeva pätast tuleb ta tagasi ja lahendab selle probleemi. Toomas Hendrik aina mõtles ja mõtles ning ei tulnud selle seitsme päeva jooksul kordagi toast välja. Seitsmendal päeval kell 3 olid Obama ja Toomas Hendrik jälle Putini juures. Toomas hendrik Putinile oma geniaalset plaani. See oli järgmine: nad peavad rotid maa seest konserviga välja meelitama, kõik rotid ükshaaval kinni püüdma ja neil vasaku silma sisse ühe seadeldise panema. Selle seadeldise nimi on Rotikarjus, see annab rottidele särtsu, kui nad maa alla peaksid tahtma minna. Mõeldud, tehtud. Toomas Hendriku plaan töötasa ja rotid ei läinud enam kunagi maa alla Õli sööma. Toomas Hendrik sai talle lubatud veerand maailmast ja kõik elasid õnnelikult elu lõpuni</p>
        <p>(Lugu kirjanduse tunni jaoks aastast 2014, kaheksandast klassist. Ülesandeks oli uurida kuidas muinasjuttudes kasutatakse numbreid ning kirjutada oma lühi-muinasjutt kasutades numbreid.)</p>
        <h4>Mõtteid aastast 2019</h4>
        <p>See oli aeg, kus ma olin just lugenud Terry Pratchetti &quot;Võlukunsti värvi&quot; ning olin väga vaimustuses tema stiilist. Proovisin ka sellesse loosse pratchettilikku huumorit ja viiteid panna parodiseerides maailma juhte ning põimides nende lugu oma enda elu tükikestega. Pisut naljakas on uuesti üle lugedes näha, kuidas läbi nalja tuleb välja senine veendumus, et Lääs - eriti USA - oli ainuke õiglane ja normaalne koht, kus elada ning Ida - eriti Venemaa - on riik, kus tundub täis kaost, ebaõiglust ja alkoholi. Utoopia siin, düstoopia seal - meie ja nemad! Ajaloo tunnid olid oma töö teinud meie aju pesuga, või mis hahaha?</p>
        <p>Loomulikult on kaa sees nutisõltuvus ja selle õigustused. Noh, minu 14-aastane suur aju pidi kuidagi endale ju veenma, et ega see arvuti ees passimine nii halb ju olla saa. Lõpuks on ikka iti-mehed need, kes maailma päästavad, onju? Kes siis naerab?</p>
        <p>Ning eks need rotid olid kaa sellel ajal korduv motiiv igas asjas. Jürgeni ja Makuga mõtlesime kogu aeg mingeid veidraid lugusid välja (torusiil loodusõpetuse klassi ventilatsiooni torudes, mädaauk ja ratastoolis L, sektor 5 ja jumal teab, mis kõik veel) ning enamasti olid rotid kuidagi sellega seotud. Seega pidin ka siia vist need sisse panema, et kui sõber loeb, siis saab kaa naerda. Sellega sain ka põhjuse anda sellele, miks rottidel meie lugudes alati vasak silm katki oli.</p>
        <p>Head ajad.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p><em>&quot;So how did this picture find it's way to becoming the profile picture to all your accounts, Jam?&quot;</em></p>
        <p>Well, go grab your cookies, hot chocolate and your favorite ふわふわ blanket, for this is an <em>EPIC</em> tale about my stupid 14-year old ass that spans from 2014 to 2015!</p>
        <p>It all started on 18th of December 2014. It was a normal Thursday. Save for that it wasn't a normal Thursday after all...</p>
        <p>The sounds of my backpack tumbling across the vestibule downstairs were still heard as the rapid thumps of my feet were already sounding upstairs. As a any average Joe after a schoolday at the age of 14, so was I in the hurry of finally getting my daily dose of videogames and Youtube videos. But little did I know... That day, the Youtube dose was laced - in the &quot;recommended&quot; tab I was greeted by this video:</p>
        <p><strong>&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLjq625UhSo">CS.GO - From Nothing To A Knife</a>&quot; by Clicky Crisp</strong></p>
        <p>It had amassed a huge viewercount of millions by the time i saw it. It had been up for exactly 3 months. As late as I was, I was completely entranced by it. The cringy motivational speeches by Leslie Calvin &quot;Les&quot; Brown, Eric D. Thomas and Thomas D. Jakes Sr. in the background as the gun skins flew by to the rising counter of value in dollars were <em>just</em> the things to push all the right buttons for me. Eyes widened, heart rate increased as my ears were transforming the speeches into pure motivation for my veins to pump around my body. <em>&quot;You mean,</em> I <em>could do this?</em> I <em>can make my favorite game into a job? At</em> my <em>age?&quot;</em></p>
        <p>My Steam's total playtime counter for GS:GO was around 200+ hours at the time, I proudly wore a competitive rank of <em>Distinguished Master Guardian</em> (which was a huge achievement at the time considering most of my peers were around <em>Gold Nova.</em> Because they weren't CS:GO maniacs lmao.) and I was well aware of the value of knives. I mean, everyone desired to have at least one to get away from the peasant's default one and I was no different. I had always wanted one, knowing it was improbable that i would ever own one - I was convinced that it was a waste of money and that I would never buy one myself. But now I saw a beacon of light. I sold all of my skins and cases to buy 2 Phoenix case keys. Those case keys were the currency of the trading market. They were the only stable item as it was the only item of which the value was determined by Valve. And those 2 Phoenix keys were the beginning of something great...</p>
        <p>NOTE: Before we go on, <a href="http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Skins">here is a quick summary</a> about the differences between skins. Rarity level, condition, Stattrak - all of it is explained there.</p>
        <h2>Phoenixes rise from the ashes</h2>
        <p><strong>2014/12/18 Total inventory value: 2 keys (4€)</strong></p>
        <p>Capital was there, now all that was left was to start the journey, to make the first move. The starting line for any trader back then was the infamous CSGOLounge:</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-01-14_18-51-23.png" alt="" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>From 2014 to 2019 and it still looks the same!</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>When my inexperienced ass arrived it was already a hellhole of crazed teenagers, who most probably got their start from the same video, looking to make a quick buck. Each trade post was accompanied by a description. If they were buying items for keys, it would be something the lines of &quot;BUYNG QUICKSELLS ONLY, B/O 70% OF MARKET VALUE!!! IF YOU WANT TO OFER ME HIGHER THEN I FCK UR MUM!&quot; If they were selling their items for keys, then the tone would suddenly change to a more polite one: &quot;Selling this rare AK47 skin, it has 2 stickers so that means it's more valuable! DONT offer me lower than 90% market value!&quot; Even the not-so-bright can see through this simple buy low, sell high strategy. Seemed logical to me, so i joined the rank and file of scum and posted my own &quot;Buying quicksells only&quot; posts. But it wasn't gonna fly with only 2 keys. No-one in their right mind was gonna quicksell a 3-key skin for 2 keys. My posts turned up nothing, instead they were met with hate.</p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 1: Market research is important.</strong></p>
        <p>So i dived into the Steam Community Market to hunt for a skin that was stable in value and at around 2,5 keys. I found 3-5 potential ones and picked 2 that looked the most appealing to me - &quot;well if I'm gonna be trading these cool skins I better enjoy them too!&quot; Then I searched up who were trying to trade those particular skins and went to bug every single one of them until one of them accepted. Enter the Minimal Wear M4A1-S | Atomic Alloy (with 2 stickers!):</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_zfjD1Ag1l0.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The ecstasy of making my first profitable trade shot my motivation up even more! Over the next 2 weeks, it became my obsession. I was online as much as I humanly could, checking notifications for any new trades, messages, anything. I no longer even played the game, I just traded. And traded. And traded. So many skins passed through my hands. I even stopped caring about the looks - all that mattered was that the profits were stable. And they were - I was making a <em>whopping average 0,3€ a day</em>! It's hilarious in hindsight, I was ecstatic about working for 'slave-wages' as they call it now, but I was having <em>so much fun</em>. Besides, the fact that the numbers were growing, was a sign that I was doing something right and consequently <em>that</em> meant I could move to bigger trades.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick tangent</strong>: There were quite a few screenshots I took and uploaded to Steam at this time and they are worth sharing here just for the pure excitement and naivety that they preserve. I'm so goddamn glad I took these, the nostalgia is immeasurable...</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-01-14_19-04-24.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-01-15_20-09-21.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-01-15_20-09-40.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>There was one notable story where I bought someone's shitty 0,05€ skin because it's Battle-Scarred condition made it look &quot;<em>almost&quot;</em> black. And my inner business man thought that he could use it to his advantage. I knew that the default skins were hated and same applied for the default dark green skin of AWP. I thought that an &quot;almost black&quot; Battle-Scarred AWP skin was a better alternative that had the potential to be sold for a whole key! Default &lt; Skin so that must mean Green &lt; Almost Black right? Buuuut the self-coined &quot;Much Black&quot; skin was more like an AWP with sand smeared all over it. Just look at the screenshots and decide for yourself if anyone actually fell for it...</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/serveimage.jpg" alt="" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>Default AWP skin</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-01-15_20-09-47.png" alt="" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>The &quot;black&quot; AWP skin (lol)</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But moving on, in the span of those 2 weeks I had found where the wealthy and dignified did their virtual-weapons-trade business transactions - on Reddit, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/">at r/GlobablGffensiveTrade</a>. This is wasn't as much of a scumhive like CSGOLounge was and it was easier to navigate + there were a bunch of useful guides, Price Evaluation threads and more that CSGOLounge lacked. Furthermore, my first wave of excitement wore off and reality hit home that I was pretty much working 5 hours for 1 key (2€), which was getting tedious. So I thought, if I'm making an x% profit off each trade, then adding more capital would surely make it worth my while! I would, at the very least, get close to the minimum wage of youth camps which I had attended once (They paid 2€/hr) and it would be way more fun, because more skins means more shiny toys to look at, brag about and take screenshots of. I liquidized my skins into keys aaaaand cue the <em>&quot;Hey, dad, I found a way to make money from a game I love, can you please put some money to my Steam account?&quot;</em></p>
        <h2>9 more phoenixes rise... from my dad's credit card</h2>
        <p><strong>2015/01/12 Total inventory value: 6+9 keys (18€)</strong></p>
        <p>Years later I asked him why he gave me the money even after I explained him that I was gonna buy case keys, which were basically for gambling under the pretense that I was gonna use them to &quot;make money by trading.&quot; And he said that a few bucks was a cheap price for the lessons I would learn either way:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>I would've learned about the worthlessness and dangers of gambling.</li>
        <li>Or I would've learned about how money, the stock market and trading works (Which I did, thankfully, instead of gambling, tho I did do that too.).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Well, 15 keys in hand, I could now set my sights on the big leagues, I bought an AK-47 | Vulcan and continued.</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-01-15_21-08-27.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>But why continue my usual way of exchanging one skin for another slightly valuable one? That wasn't netting me much and it felt that with a bigger bank there must be a better way. Few trades later I got to a Battle-Scarred AWP | Asiimov. Then, a day later I got my hands on an improved, more expensive Field-Tested variant of the same gun which, as I learned, were very widely used for betting on the results of professional CS:GO matches, as for some reason they were one of the most stable items. They were aptly named the Field-Tested Betiimovs. Trading those Betiimovs served me well - I saw that I could buy these at a bargain from gamblers who wanted to liquidize their winnings fast and sell it to other gamblers who needed them for their next fix and didn't bother hunting for cheap prices.</p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 2: Gamblers are easy to profit off of.</strong></p>
        <p>A few beloved Betiimovs later I got an offer. 12 skins for another one of my Betiimovs I had just gotten. At first I thought that was ridiculous, why would I accept this trade? It would be a nightmare to sell them off one by one. But, being the overly enthusiastic thorough market analyst that I was I could not let any trade go unchecked from the fear of losing on profits. So I collected the Community Market prices, checked their stability, ran over the demand and key prices on r/GlobalOffensiveTrade and CSGOLounge on every single gun and saw that this guy was overpaying by quite a lot! This had potential... <em>&quot;Maybe he's gullible, lemme haggle it even higher!&quot;</em> After some stupid arguments about how he had to overpay even more to make it worth my while to sell these individually he added an extra 2 skins for a total of 14. I had gotten the Betiimov for 26 keys and this offer was worth around 32-34 keys.</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/firefox_2019-01-17_19-10-42.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>I pulled the trigger and went ham on trying to sell these things. I maxed the r/GlobalOffensiveTrade and CSGOLounge trade post limits and ultimately got 31 keys out of these skins in the span of 2 days. It took more work than haggling Betiimovs (Because I had to sell off a boatload of skins instead of 1), but I made 4 keys off this and that was double of what I would've made otherwise. And this particular trade was significant for it finally put me in the range of my prized goal...</p>

        <p>&quot;God damn, i love the flip it makes when you equip it! ★ Bayonet | Urban Masked Field-Tested&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Holy fuck! I actually made it happen!</p>
        <p>I was sure to tell everyone. My family, friends, everyone got to experience all of my <a href="https://youtu.be/hLjq625UhSo?t=112">capacity, strength and sagacity, faith, hope and confidence, stern pertinacity.</a> In my eyes, I was a GOD, I was a MONEY PRINTER, nothing could stop me... Before long I would be a millionaire, I could then buy all the games, potato chips and soda I could imagine, I would get all the girls in my class, I would revive the dinosaurs, bring world peace and become the ruler of the galaxy!</p>
        <p>Well, it was an important day for me. A huge landmark. Nevertheless, after jumping around admiring the symbol of my achievement on an empty server, there wasn't a moment to lose. This knife was dear to me, sure, but how could I be satisfied knowing I could get an even better one! And then an even better one still!</p>
        <p>Over the next days I made an average of 1 trade a day. My strategy was:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Buy knife with keys at a quicksell price</li>
        <li>Sell knife for a 1-3 keys profit</li>
        <li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
        <li>???</li>
        <li>Profit</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I knew I was making less than I could have with other strategies, but I <em>loved</em> jumping from knife to knife as seen from the screenshots on Steam Community and their cute captions:</p>

        <p>Actually, I found another comfort spot for a few days alongside Betiimovs - the Field-Tested Crimson Web Flip Knives were pretty popular for some reason. I traded through 4 different ones before getting bored of knives and moved back to Betiimovs. Only difference now was that I could afford 2 of them at once, so my profit margins rose. Then after a week I could afford the vanilla Bayonet variants, which I traded for a few days before moving back to those beloved Betiimovs again.</p>

        <p><strong>2015/02/10 Total inventory</strong> <strong>value: 62 keys (124€)</strong></p>
        <p>Before I mentioned how toxic the trading platform of choice for cash hungry teenager known as CSGOLounge was. And back then I was disgusted with how people there acted too, and so I decided to be better. Even if they were my rivals and competitors, I tried my best to treat every trader with respect. Of course it wasn't an entirely altruistic decision. It was partly because I knew that people would be less likely to trade if I acted like an asshole - I myself had turned down many trades from douchebags alike. And I <em>did</em> get a &quot;oh okay, you're the first polite trader I have met here so I'll accept your terms&quot; once in a blue moon. But at the same time it felt good to be the change that I wanted to see. And it actually worked in my favor at this time, because I met someone great from this...</p>
        <p>One day, searching for my next Betiimov purchase I was met with a friend request from who I will call M. from now on. It was now my turn to experience the once in a blue moon event of meeting a stranger that didn't want to suck me dry of money while insulting me and damning my family to eternal hell. I was met with a warm demeanor and (mostly) correct grammar, which impressed me. He wanted to discuss a trade, obviously, but that fell through as we both realized that we were on the same journey of making as much money with no desire to trade skins for our personal pleasure. Just as two real estate brokers would not be able to sell each other houses, we could not sell each other skins we only wanted for resale. Profit was not made that night, what was made instead that night was my first internet-friendship. We spent the whole evening chatting about our lives, the state of our countries, what we wanted to achieve with trading and probably some other things too. I actually slept in because of this heartfelt chat. What was especially interesting is the heartwarming exchange of our very different worlds - he was an adult and taught me about what he had experienced (girls, money, work, dreams, schools, travel) and I taught him everything I knew about trading (mostly about Betiimovs). I am saddened that Steam does not keep chatlogs, but I remember holding that chat close to my heart. In fact the more we talked the more I respected him. At first I was suspicious about this grown-ass man tolerating a 15-year old's banters - there must be an underlying goal. But that turned out to be bogus, he turned out to be a genuine respectable man. And I decided to gift him a skin that he seemed to love a lot, he had mentioned it as one of his dream skins.</p>

        <p><em>As of 2019/01/19 aka 4 years later, it's still in his inventory!</em></p>

        <p>The Minimal Wear (I could not afford a Factory New one I guess, haha.) Glock-18 Water Elemental. Many such skins have passed through my inventory with similar tags: &quot;From X to Y&quot; and it has always been a sorry sight seeing that people have traded their gifts away. My old friend, M., who I haven't talked to, but who has remained in my friendlist did not trade my gift away. And for that I am deeply grateful.</p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 3: Sometimes strangers on the Net are respectable humans too.</strong></p>
        <h2>A tempting apple called &quot;the game of chance&quot;</h2>
        <p><strong>2015/03/10 Total inventory value: 126 keys (252€)</strong></p>
        <p>It was around march that I realized I had enough money to actually start spending some of it without losing out on trading. A fiver here and there wouldn't change if I could buy the next round of Betiimovs or a new knife. So this month saw an uptick of game purchases, a huge uptick if I'm honest. I also sold quite a few keys to my classmates around this time. One of them made 3 transactions with me for betting, which he sadly lost. I'd say it was sad, but it's not, considering the circumstances and his choice of &quot;betting strategy&quot; - kids, betting is bad and even if you do decide to bet anyway <em>don't</em> go all in. A few of the keys I sold to classmates who also wanted to get a piece of this &quot;easy money&quot; I was making after seeing my inventory, but none of my peers had the patience for this.</p>
        <p>Eventually I actually started betting myself. I didn't really know anything about the teams, so I mostly lost. It wasn't until I discovered <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/csgobetting/">r/csgobetting</a> that I started making some money. There were daily threads about matches with people analysing the teams with extensive knowledge and I started blindly following them. Surprisingly it worked well enough, but then I paid a couple of well known professionals a fee to get their insights for a month. I won some, I lost some, but in the end I came out a winner. At least from the perspective of gambling. That is, I didn't actually gain any money from betting, I came out of it with neutral to slight gain (a few bucks at best). And let me tell you, if you come out of a month long gambling craze with neutral balance, then you <em>won</em>. I'm glad I realised that gambling wasn't profitable and was taking too much of my time that I could spend trading. Back to my good old Betiimovs...</p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 4: Only the house wins</strong> <strong>in gambling.</strong></p>
        <h2>Museum of knives</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>2015/04/29 Total inventory value: about 400 keys (800€)</strong> (It becomes hard to track the exact amount of keys from the trade logs from here on because I was trading multiple items daily)</li>
        <li><strong>2015/04/29</strong> <strong>Total money cashed out: about 150 keys (300€)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2015/04/29</strong> <strong>Total cases opened: 15 keys (30€)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2015/04/29</strong> <strong>Total value of games bought: about 40 keys (80€)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not much more notable happened during this time, aside from the huge profits I was making. I made quite a few screenshots of knives and rare skins I got to try out from this time that lay out the progression nicely and will lead us to this journey's climax:</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>The last picture of the skin above, of the M4A4 | Howl, is significant because it had been my dream skin from the beginning. Secondly, it was a Contraband weapon, which meant it was no longer available from lootcrates. It turned out the community created skin had <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-howl-skin/2/">violated a DeviantArt user's copyright</a> and was thus changed by valve and then made into a Contraband skin. If you wanted one, you had to buy one with a lot of money or trade for it. It was extremely valuable, rare and above all it was the best looking non-knife skin at that time.</p>

        <p><em>Original artwork that inspired the skin.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Thirdly, this is where I got my profile picture. Achieving this skin was the symbol that I had achieved everything I set out to do and then some. I never would have thought that I would be one day wielding the Minimal Wear Howl, which valued at over 300 keys. But there I was, and to celebrate I photoshopped myself a profile picture to always remind myself this monumental experience of my life.</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/2019-01-19_14-58-55.gif" alt="" /></p>
        <p>I was an amateur at Photoshop, but the result looks decent if I do say so myself</p>
        <h2>The bigger they are the harder they fall</h2>
        <p>Betiimovs as a motif is presistent throughout this story, it is only fair to Chekov that the gun must now fire.</p>
        <p>As much as I was trading the Betiimovs, it made sense to find regular sellers. And I had one that consistently sold me multiple each day. He went by the alias of &quot;luca boring.&quot; We had conversed multiple times and I was starting to like him. But one day he said he probably will no longer be able to supply me with any more Asimoovs. Then he proposed to buy all of my inventory for Steam Wallet. I was hesitant, but he persisted, increasing his part of the deal to an extraordinary amount. I sort of felt that it was a bit too good to be true, but I also knew that people did ask for huge overpays when trading with Steam Wallet instead of skins or keys. I was conflicted - luca persisted. In the end he offered me such a deal that I was blinded, and I agreed. Before going through with this I transferred a quarter of my inventory to a secondary account. He bought 2 of my worthless skins on the Steam Marketplace for the total of 478€ and I traded him 151 keys for a profit of 88 keys - FROM A SINGLE TRADE! My profit graph had the sharpest bull ever in history. And everything was going great! I continued trading and trading and even foun-</p>
        <h2>You have been permanently banned for fraudulent activity</h2>
        <p>On the first of April of all days <em>that</em> was the message on my screen when I tried to log into my Steam account.</p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 5: If it seems too good to be true, it is.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 5: The Devil is with the face of a friend.</strong></p>
        <p>Hindsight is 20/20 and I would spank my 15-year old self for being the braindead kid that I was. Young me saw a way to make a quick buck and that was enough for his brain to slide out of his ass. What was I thinking... Oh right, I wasn't thinking at all. But anyway, I wasn't gonna accept my fate. I posted on CS:GO subreddits asking for advice and even got added by a couple of nice guys who had met the same fate. Some of them even recognised &quot;luca boring.&quot; We formed a support group of sorts and tried to help each other with the latest info about their support tickets and other similar cases, one of them even helped me write my emails (Back then I did not know how to write formal emails.). And thanks to the people in reddit it dawned on me that he was a big time scammer who was laundering money from stolen credit cards. I also wrote an email to Steam Support, but was met with a canned response from a bot. Over the next weeks I sent Support quite a number of emails, but to no avail - only their automated bots got the pleasure of dismissing my pleas. If only I would get the chance to talk with an actual human - they would understand, right?</p>
        <p>Meanwhile I continued trading from my second account, but I wasn't that into it any more. Sort of understandable, haha. I did a couple of trades here and there to buy a few games, but I was done with it. At the end of 2015 summer I cashed my remains out, which was about 200€.</p>
        <p>The en- BUT WAIT! Half a year later, on the 11th of November 2015 I get a message from one of the guys in the &quot;support group.&quot; He says he has been unbanned and he got back all of his inventory.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>WHAT THE FUCK</p>
        <h2>JAM RISES FROM THE ASHES!</h2>
        <p>That day, I told the school nurse that I was sick and skipped rest of the school day. The sounds of my backpack tumbling across the vestibule downstairs were still heard as the rapid clacks of my keyboard already sounding upstairs as I was writing a new email to Steam Support. A few days later I got a response - from an actual human! After a few exchanges where I explained the whole thing from top to bottom, providing ample proof in the process I got unbanned. I immediately got all of my motivation back. It was time to break new records!</p>
        <p>What followed was not interesting enough to recount here. It was the standard buy knives/Betiimovs and sell for keys, rinse and repeat. There were a few nice screenshots that I took tho, so here's a small selection of them:</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/730_screenshots_2015-12-02_00002-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

        <p><em>2015/12/05 <strong>M9 Bayonet| Tiger Tooth</strong> (Factory New)</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But after coming back in half a year something had changed... I noticed that items sold way slower than usual and people were way more stingier with prices. It just wasn't worth it for me anymore. Even at my size of my inventory at 400 keys, I was making 1 to 2 keys profit each trade. That was way lower than I was used to. It was like a warehouse, full of real estate brokers that tried to buy houses from each other with the only goal of reselling them and that's a cul-de-sac if I've ever seen one. It just didn't work. So I decided to stop, I cashed out most of my inventory for 900€ and left some of it there just in case I wanted to buy some games or come back to trading (which I did not).</p>
        <h2>All things must come to an end</h2>
        <p>A spectacular story if I do say so myself. Not sure how well that worked as a written one, but for me, as it was happening, it was one of the most important and profound journeys of my life. I'm not sure how to end this so I say to you all as the 12-year old player Adam &quot;at0m&quot; Keitel said after winning a knife battle with the professional CS:GO player iBUYPOWER swag: <a href="https://youtu.be/BguduSz9VXA">&quot;Winners drink milk!~&quot;</a></p>

        <p>Ühiskond, mille inimesed endale loovad, on korrelatsioonis nende enda väärtushinnangute ja tõekspidamistega. Seega, et üldse jõuda täiusliku ühiskonnani, peavad selle liikmed ise muutuma, täiuslikuks ja küpseks saama. Üldsoovitud täiusliku ühiskonna tunnused nagu rahu, absoluutne tolerantsus ning täielik võrdsus jäävad kättesaadamatuks, kui neisse suhtutakse kui kaugesse potentsiaalsesse tulevikku ning ei rakendata nende omaduste elluviimiseks vajalikke põhitõdesid igapäevaelus.</p>
        <p>Kui kõik suhtuvad oma ligimestesse kui konkurentidesse, kellest peab üle olema, siis kuidas on võimalik saavutada rahu, võrdusus ja tolerantsus? Konkurents mõistena on otseses vastuolus kõigi nende tunnustega - ühe suhteline edu tähendab teise ebaedu. Nii saab võimuvõitlus lapsepõlves oma sõbraga teemal, kellel on ägedam mänguauto tuleviku peaministri võimuvõitluseks teiste riikidega teemal, kellel on ägedam tuumapomm.</p>
        <p>Vaid teadvustatud otsused võivad viia inimkonna küpsuseni, et see saaks luua ideaalse ühiskonna. See saab aga alguse kasvatusest. Suuresti on tänapäeva kasvatus liiga leebe ja põhineb valedel põhitõdedel. Kui varakult anda lapsele liiga vabad käed ja võimalus juhuslikult kujuneda, siis viib see tihti mõtteviisideni, mida iseloomustavad emotsionaalsus, nõrk enesekontroll ja isekus. 21. sajandil on näha, kuidas paljudele lastele antakse üsna varakult nutitelefon kätte, et lihtsustada oma tööd lapsevanematena. Telefonis olev sisu on aga väga tihti disainitud inimeste nõrku külgi ära kasutama, suurem enamus rakendusi on kavandatud nii, et kasutaja oleks võimalikult kaua aktiivne ning tuleks võimalikult tihti tagasi. See õpetab väärtustama kiiresti kättesaadavaid naudinguid ja ajendab käituma rohkem instiktide põhjalt, kui mõistuse põhjalt. Kas on võimalik luua tolerantne, võrdne ja rahulik ühiskond, kui kõik juhilduvad oma otsuste tegemisel vaid enda eesmärkidest ja ihadest?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Internet pakub meile täpselt neid sensoorseid ja kognitiivseid stiimuleid - korduvad, intensiivsed, interaktiivsed, sõltuvust tekitavad - mis on näidanud põhjustavat tugevaid ja kiireid muutusi aju ehituses.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Carr, The Shallows</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Tähtsaimaks elemendiks kasvatusel on distsipliin. Distsipliin võimaldab saavutada vabaduse instinktidest ja mõelda loogiliselt, isetult ja perspektiivikalt. Tavaliselt mõeldakse vabaduse all takistuste ja piirangute puudumist ning valikuvabadust. Kui inimese põhilised vajadused Maslowi püramiidil on täidetud, siis on liigagi lihtne ja ahvatlev asendada uute eesmärkide seadmine ja nende elluviimine eskapismi ja muude viivitustega. Kas seda võiks nimetada vabaduseks, kui inimesel on võimalus vahetada eneseteostus meelelahutuse vastu? Või on ta siiski aheldatud oma ihade poolt, mida ta pole endale tunnistanud? Tõeline valikuvabadus on distsipliin, mis annab võime vaadelda valikuid kriitiliselt ning küsida, kas valik mille ma teen on tõesti parim või on see tunnistamata alateadlik iha.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Otsi vabadust ja saa oma ihade vangiks. Otsi distsipliini ja leia oma vabadus.</p>
        <p>Frank Herbert, Düün</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Täieliku ühiskonna loomine nõuab ka teadliku naiivsuse. Naiivsuse all mõtlen mõtteprotsessi põhimõttel &quot;rohkem küsimusi, vähem vastuseid,&quot; ehk uue info ja varasemate teadmiste üksteisest distantseerimist. Niivõrd kui universum on alati muutuv ning miski ei ole igavene, ei saa täiuslikku ühiskonda luua selle mõttega, et kui täiuslikkus on saavutatud, siis see ei muutu. Naiivsus on see, mis võimaldab meil alati kahelda oma tõekspidamistes ning see on oluline, sest kinnistunud ideed, arusaamad ja teadmised on need, mis pärsivad õppimisvõimet ja arengut. Fraas &quot;ma tean seda&quot; on ohtlik, sest see võib muutuda isiku absoluutseks vankumatuks tõeks. Kuid absoluutset tõde ei eksisteeri - tõde on alati mitmuses, muutuv ja ambivalentne. Seega, kui keegi võtab omaks mõne absoluutse tõe, siis hakkab ta neid mitmusi ja muutusi eitama, tõrjuma sellega takistades enda, ning osadel juhtudel ka teiste, progressi</p>

        <h2>Oversociety</h2>
        <p>Society, which people create for themselves, is in direct correlation with their values and beliefs. Society is where values and beliefs of its people are expressed through. So to reach a perfect society, its members themselves must change and become perfect and mature. Common features of an ideal society, like peace, absolute tolerance and total equality will remain out of reach if they are viewed as something that will be achieved in the vague distant future, &quot;when the time is right.&quot; The ideal society isn't something that will one day pop up - it can only come about when its underlying truths are put into practice in everyday lives.</p>
        <p>If everyone acts towards their surrounding people like they are their rivals, just another bar to pass, then how is it possible to achieve peace, equality and tolerance? Rivalry as a word expresses something that is directly at odds with all three. One's relative gain is another's loss. It's the conflict of who's got a cooler toy car in a prime minister's childhood that leads to the similar conflict of who's got a cooler weapons of mass destruction in adulthood.</p>
        <p>Only conscious decisions may lead man to its adulthood so that it may create the perfect society. It all begins with correct upbringing. I feel that, at large, parents today are too lenient and raise their children with wrong philosophies. If a child is given too much freedom and let be raised by chance itself, then that usually leads to strong emotionality, lack of self-control and selfishness. We can see parents in the 21st century try to make their job as parents easier by handing them the smartphone. However, the content inside the smartphone is mostly designed to exploit the weaker sides of humans in subtle, unnoticeable ways. They are psychologically engineered to keep their users attached for as long as possible and to keep them coming back as much as possible. This teaches to value the short term rewards and instant gratification and to live from the basis of instinct and not from the basis of rationality. Is an ideal - tolerant, equal and peaceful - society even possible if most of us are only guided by <em>their own</em> desires and goals?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The Net delivers precisely the kind of sensory and cognitive stimuli – repetitive, intensive, interactive, addictive – that have been shown to result in strong and rapid alterations in brain circuits and functions.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Carr, The Shallows</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The most important element that should be taught to everyone is discipline.<br />
        Discipline allows one to achieve freedom from instincts and think logically, selflessly, and prospectively. Usually, freedom is meant as the absence of obstacles, constraints and having the freedom of choice. If a person's basic needs in the Maslow's pyramid are met, it is too easy and tempting to replace the setting of new goals and their implementation with escapism and other delays. Can this be called an act of freedom if a person has chosen to exchange self-realization for entertainment? Or is he still chained - by his desires, which he has not even acknowledged? True freedom of choice is discipline that gives the ability to look at choices through analysis and ask am I doing this because it is really the best choice or is it of my unacknowledged subconscious desires.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.”</p>
        <p>Frank Herbert, Dune</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Furthermore, naivety should be the second most important element one gets from their upbringing to their mental toolkit. By naivety I mean the ability to distance previous knowledge from new information and the thought process of &quot;more questions, less answers.&quot; To the extent that the universe is always changing and nothing is eternal, the perfect society cannot be created with the idea that once perfection is achieved it will not change again. Naivety is what allows us to always doubt our beliefs and that is important because the deeply embedded ideas, insights and pieces of knowledge are the ones that inhibit learning and mental development. The phrase &quot;I know it&quot; is dangerous because it can become an absolute unshakable truth of a person. But the absolute truth does not exist - the truth is always plural, changing and ambivalent. So, if someone takes on some absolute truth, they start denying these pluralities and changes, they start preventing themselves and, in some cases, others from progressing.</p>

        <p>Tatsuki is back... with a vengeance!</p>
        <h2>The rise, fall and <em>(hopefully)</em> rise of Tatsuki</h2>
        <p>The stories around Tatsuki, the director of Kemurikusa, are as odd as the stuff he produces. And I think it's worth noting here, so before going on to my thoughts on Kemurikusa, here's an quick detour into Tatsuki's &quot;adventures&quot;. He previously directed a little something called <em><strong>Kemono Friends</strong></em> which aired in 2017 winter anime season. It was born from an <em>extremely</em> cheap multi-media project and, honestly, it was destined to fail. Just a quick search on it suffices and one can see that it doesn't look inviting. What you see is shitty high-school level Blender CG models of anthropomorphised girls (&quot;Oh not agian, Japan!&quot;) that move like someone hand baked the animations in Unity or something. For the first few episodes they didn't even have enough budget to make the wheels of a car in the opening spin for goodness sake! It's all colorful, full of energy and high-pitched voices to top it all off (&quot;Haven't seen that before in anime!&quot;). Seems like a stupid morning cartoon for kids (Well, that's technically correct...) or some moe otaku bait, eh? Well I'll let this graph speak for itself...</p>
        <p><img src="https://jamfox.dev/images/1bLAPcv.png" alt="" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>anime-stats.net 2019</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Even the shittier shows of a season start at an average score of around 6. And that's right, from 4.4 average score right up to 7.4. This underdog (an understatement if i'm honest) really blew the community away and won the hearts of many that definitely didn't fit into the projected target demographic of 6-year olds. The graph more so represents the western opinion of it, but after the show ended there were quite a few articles about Japanese zoos being saved from bankruptcy because suddenly, for some unknown reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, people wanted to go to the zoo. Even many of the animals were named after the characters from the show. It's safe to say that it managed to do something special. Few months later, the show got to 7.7 on MyAnimeList thanks to the Twitch Anime Marathon that took place on 2017 summer, which is where I discovered it. And man am I glad for that Marathon, if it weren't for the Twitch chat's shenanigans I probably wouldn't have touched Kemono Friends with a 10-foot pole. In the end, not only did I finish the whole thing, but I gave it a flippin' 8/10 and that's a huge score in my books.</p>
        <p>BUT, then disaster struck and the director was fired- WhAT?! Yep, the passionate dude who'd done the lions share of the work out of the total 5 or so people working on the destined-to-fail-project got fired out of the blue for some hazy reasons. Well, i don't know the details well enough and it's more depressing than interesting, but <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/72m5mz/what_the_kemono_friends_fuzz_is_about_today/">here's a nice recap</a>. In the end, he was dropped out of the Kemono Friends 2 project and he decided to say fuck it and do his own thing knowing that there are people who love his work.</p>
        <h2>Kemurikusa Episode 1</h2>
        <p>It's weird. In the best way. Once again!</p>
        <p>Back with the same CG style, but now with a little more refined animations at least! Actually i think the CG works <em>for</em> the show. Same for this and Kemono Furenzu, it gives it a very personal and heartwarming feel. There's an actual heart to these projects and a real passion behind its team and it shows through the design visual and sound design choices. Continuing with the similarities, once again there aren't needless exposition dumps like there usually are in anime. The show really takes it's time to explain things and sometimes let's the viewer figure it out themselves and it's oh-so-nice to not be treated like a total idiot even when it's possibly a children's show.</p>
        <p>But actually, Kemurikusa seems very different from Kemono Friends when it comes to the story so far. Kemono was super light-hearted for most of the show and it shows that the real target audience for this were children and not the 20-something males on r/anime (Me included lmao) that got a kick from the surprising dark lore hidden in the subtext. I suppose Tatsuki realised that his fanbase was more than just kids and went for something a little darker than the constant TANOSHIIIIII this time. Kemurikusa is pretty dark from it's color palette and mood to it's hints at the coming themes. It's not gonna be very cerebral, that's for sure, but as a short expressive show from the passionate people that put their hearts into this to remind me of simpler times? I sure as hell am gonna enjoy it if the first episode is anything to go by!</p>
